The International Air Transport Association (Iata) has reported that 2018 saw more passengers fly than ever before, record airline efficiency, record fuel efficiency and more city-pairs connected than previously. Additionally, the real cost of air transport last year was half of what it had cost 20 years ago. This information was contained in the 'Iata World Air Transport Statistics 2019' report. Last year saw 4.4-billion passengers fly, which was a 6.9% rise in comparison to 2017. This represented an increase of 284-million air trips. With this traffic, the airlines were able to fill 81.9% of their available seats. Fuel efficiency was more than 12% better than in 2010. The number of city-pairs connected by direct flights was 1 300 greater than in 2017, bringing the total to 22 000. And the real cost of air transport is now some $0.78 per revenue (metric) ton-kilometre. “Airlines are connecting more people and places than ever before,” pointed out Iata director-general and CEO Alexandre de Juniac. “The freedom to fly is more accessible than ever. And our world is a more prosperous place as a result.” Overall, airline capacity (measured in available seat kilometres) grew by 6.9% last year. But low cost carrier (LCC) capacity grew much faster, by 13.4%. LCCs were responsible for 21% of global air transport capacity in 2018, as against 11% in 2004. With regard to available seats, LCCs had a worldwide share of 29% – a figure that was reflective of the fact they focus on short-haul flights – in comparison to their share of 16% in 2004. Regarding air cargo and air mail, measured in freight (metric) ton kilometres, last year this increased by 3.4% over 2017 (which had been a year of strong air cargo growth, seeing an increase of 9.7% over 2016). An increase of air cargo capacity of 5.2% in 2018 resulted in a decrease in the load factor of 0.8%, to 49.3%. “We understand that sustainability is essential to our licence to spread aviation’s benefits,” he assured. “From 2020 we will cap net carbon emissions growth. And, by 2050, we will cut our net carbon footprint to half 2005 levels. This ambitious climate action goal needs government support [however].”
