Below normal rainfall is anticipated over the central and south-eastern parts of South Africa during late spring, while above normal rainfall is expected during early summer to mid-summer in the central and eastern regions, the department of agriculture, forestry and fisheries said on Wednesday, citing the national weather service. In a statement, the department said drought conditions persisted in some parts of the country, with water restrictions still in place in several provinces. The average level of major dams had increased in the Western Cape but decreased in other provinces. It said farmers should approach the season with caution, with dryland farmers advised to wait for sufficient moisture before planting and to consider drought resistant cultivars and short season cultivars. "Farmers using irrigation should be mindful of the forecast, that is, dam levels might not be replenished as quickly while irrigating due to the expected high temperatures," the department said. Farmers should keep livestock in balance with carrying capacity of the veld and provide additional feed such as relevant licks, it added.
