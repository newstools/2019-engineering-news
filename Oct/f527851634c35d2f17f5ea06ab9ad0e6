Construction has started on the new R216-million Ekhaya Mall, in Embalenhle, Mpumalanga. The R172-million Phase 1 development, including a Cashbuild and a Sasol filling station, is expected to bring shopping convenience to the community of Embalenhle, Secunda, in the coalfields of Mpumalanga, when it opens in the fourth quarter of 2020. Preparation work for the mall began in September, and bulk excavations are currently under way on site. Construction of the top structure is expected to start at the beginning of November. The Ekhaya Mall is being developed by S-Identity Holdings and co-owned by S-Identity Holdings, Cashbuild South Africa and Nomatiki Trading Enterprise. The mall will ultimately offer some 14 000 m2 of retail space. Its owners are taking a prudent phased approach to the development, with this being done in gradually increasing phases, owing to the current challenging South African economic environment, and only developing space that has been leased, S-Identity Holdings director David Lieberman indicated. “The mall’s Phase 1 retail space is already 93% let. Phase 2 is now 65% leased and we are planning the start of that phase before completing the construction of Phase 1,” added Lieberman. With a tenant mix especially selected for its community, the Ekhaya Mall will include a convenient line-up of South Africa’s most popular retail brands, along with unique regional concept stores. The mall will also feature a medical component, including prominent medical and health practitioners Francois Pretorius GP, Reino Muller Biokinetics and Impilo Diagnostic X-Rays. Situated at the intersection of the R580 and the R546, the mall is ideally located to serve the community of Embalenhle, as well as consumers from nearby Evander, Secunda and Trichardspruit. The project is expected to create about 960 temporary jobs during the construction phase and about 390 permanent jobs when the mall opens.
