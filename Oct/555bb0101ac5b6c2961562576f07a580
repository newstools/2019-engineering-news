Europe-based global aerospace group Airbus released its consolidated financial results for the first nine months of this year on Wednesday. The company also released its guidance for the full year. Revenues for the period came to €46.2-billion, which was 14% up on the €40.4-billion achieved in the same period last year. This increase was largely the result of increased deliveries of aircraft, the development of foreign exchange rates and what the group called “a favourable mix”. Reported earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit) came to €3.4-million, and reported earnings a share to €2.81. The respective figures for the first nine months of last year were €2.7-million and €1.88. “Our nine-month results are mainly driven by the performance in commercial aircraft, reflecting both the A320neo ramp-up and progress on the A350,” affirmed Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury. “We are focused on the A320neo ramp-up and improving the industrial flow while managing the higher level of complexity on the A321 ACF in particular.” (The A320neo is the upgraded “new engine option” version of the A320 single-aisle airliner family – there is also a neo version of the A330 widebody airliner. The A321 ACF is the Airbus Cabin Flex version of the largest member of the A320neo family. The A321 ACF has a modified fuselage allowing it to accommodate more flexible cabin configurations and up to 240 passengers. The A350 is the group’s latest generation widebody airliner.) During the first nine months of this year, Airbus delivered 422 A320-family aircraft, of which 338 were -neo versions. A330 deliveries came to 34, of which 26 were A330neo versions. Airbus Defence and Space delivered ten A400M military transport aircraft. “Our nine-month delivery numbers and the updated delivery outlook for the year reflect the underlying actions to secure a more efficient delivery flow in the next years as we progress to rate 63 per month for the A320 Family in 2021,” he said. “We are focused on meeting our customer commitments and preparing the production system for the future.” In terms of guidance, the group expects to deliver some 860 commercial aircraft this year. It also expects its “Ebit Adjusted” for the year to be about 15% higher than for last year.
