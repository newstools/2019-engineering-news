The Department of Employment and Labour said on Wednesday it would this week host an iron and steel forum in Durban to reflect on the progress made since the signing of an accord on occupational health and safety in 2013. In a statement, it said the meeting would focus on regulations and programmes for the automotive and manufacturing sectors, discuss safety in the iron and steel sector and examine global strategies for the reduction of adverse incidents. Officials say statistics collected by the department through the Unemployment Insurance Fund and the Compensation Fund as well as inspections conducted reveal that the iron and steel sector still records high numbers of fatalities, injuries and diseases. The conference will bring together  occupational health and safety inspectors and industry specialists to develop strategies on preventing such incidents.
