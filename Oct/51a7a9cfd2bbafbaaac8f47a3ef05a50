As the dam levels in Limpopo dropped from 50.5% last week to 49.8% this week, the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) warns that water restrictions could possibly be applied to assist in conservation of this valuable resource. Raising a red flag for the DWS is Tzaneen dam, the levels of which contracted from 7.2% to 6.3% week-on-week, threatening the citrus industry should rain not fall heavily within the next two weeks. In addition, nearby Giyani’s main source of water, the Middel-Letaba dam, is virtually empty at 3.2%. The department’s construction unit is on site to erect a pipeline to feed supply water from Nandoni dam to Giyani. A Ministerial National Rapid Response Task Team identified Giyani among several hotspots in the country where intervention will be urgently implemented. Other hotspots in Limpopo included Mogalakwena in Capricorn, Modimolle, Bela-Bela, Thabazimbi and Polokwane. The Polokwane Water Supply System levels decreased to 48% from 48.9% last week, while the Luvuvhu Water Supply System is currently sitting at 83.8% this week showing a decline compared to last year when the reading was at 94.0%, the DWS noted in an update on Thursday. “Other hotspot areas were identified in the Eastern Cape, the Northern Cape and North West, where the drought has led to extremely dry conditions,” the department commented. Butterworth, Lusikisiki, Port Alfred and Alfred Nzo in the Eastern Cape, as well as Aggeneys in the Namakwa District in the Northern Cape made the list. Parts of the Eastern Cape are experiencing severely dry conditions that have prompted the provincial government to declare them natural disasters. The water situation in North West and the Eastern Cape provinces remain bleak as dam levels dropped to 50% each.
