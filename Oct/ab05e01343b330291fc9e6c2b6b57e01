The City of Cape Town has, following the Municipal Planning Tribunal meeting last week, approved the R14-billion Harbour Arch mixed-use precinct. Buoyed by the outcome, property development, investment and project management group Amdec Group CEO James Wilson said the company had “no doubt this project holds tremendous promise for the Mother City”. He added that Harbour Arch would create jobs and opportunities, boost investor confidence both locally and abroad, and bolster Cape Town’s economy, while simultaneously benefitting the entire Western Cape province. Within the context of the burgeoning Cape Town central business district, Harbour Arch occupies a strategic position at the convergence of major access roads, with easy entry points to and from the N1 and N2 highways, Amdec said in a statement on Monday. Harbour Arch is set to be built on a 5.8 ha site, with 198 000 m2 of usable space and six individual towers. The site will also be home to two new hotels, to be operated by Marriott International, which is a long-standing partner of Amdec Group. The development is also set to create a world-class new urban precinct that will deliver multiple lifestyle benefits and create a highly sought-after place to live, work and relax for residents and visitors to Cape Town. Harbour Arch represents a massive private sector investment into the city, estimated to create at least 13 000 construction jobs. Work on Harbour Arch is set to get under way imminently.
