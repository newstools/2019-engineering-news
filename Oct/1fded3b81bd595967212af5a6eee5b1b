Tyre manufacturer Bridgestone South Africa (SA) has entered into a strategic partnership with SA Taxi for the supply of a tyre specifically designed for the Toyota minibus taxi. The tyre will be locally produced, at the Bridgestone plant in the North West. SA Taxi finances entrepreneurs who operate minibus taxis that may not otherwise have access to credit from traditional banks. The South African National Taxi Council owns 25% of SA Taxi. This SA Taxi deal is specific to the Bridgestone 613V 195/R15C sized tyre, which will be known in the market as the Bridgestone Taxi R15. The partnership is the first of its kind between a tyre manufacturer and the taxi industry. This deal means that a higher quality tyre, normally targeted at premium customers, will be available at a more affordable price point. Under the programme, the current retail price of R1 700 will be reduced to R1 322.50. “The introduction of the Taxi R15 will result in an increase in demand and sales for Bridgestone tyres,” says Bridgestone SA CEO Jacques Fourie. He notes that the minibus taxi industry makes up around 90% of the taxi industry in South Africa. He says there are roughly 150 000 minibus taxis in South Africa, generating around R50-billion in revenue a year and transporting around 15-million people a day. Around 20 000 owners employ more than 200 000 people. There are roughly 1 200 different active taxi associations in operation, consuming an estimated R3-billion in fuel each year. Fourie notes that about 36 lives are lost on South Africa’s roads every day, of which three relate to taxi incidents. In total, 11.2% of fatal road crashes in South Africa are related to tyre issues. Fourie says the minibus taxi industry consumes around a million tyres a year. The Taxi R15 will be available from Supa Quick outlets nationwide and accredited SA Taxi Auto repair centres. Any other tyre which Bridgestone and SA Taxi may agree on from time to time will also be included in the programme.
