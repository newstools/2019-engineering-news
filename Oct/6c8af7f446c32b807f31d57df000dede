The Mpumalanga Stainless Initiative (MSI) and the Small Enterprise Development Agency (Seda) have launched the Mpumalanga Informal Welders Recruitment Programme. MSI CEO Victor Mashego says the programme will assist welders in rural areas and townships gain access to the market and grow their businesses, which will contribute to job creation. "We are happy that we finally launched this much anticipated programme. President Cyril Ramaphosa stated the central role incubators must play in assisting the country to deal with our ever-growing unemployment rate. As a direct response, MSI decided to come up with this initiative," he adds. MSI and Seda also plan to establish a provincial welders and fabricators portal and an easy-to-use mobile app to further assist recruited small and medium-sized enterprises to access international and domestic market opportunities. Candidates will be given training to enable them to start new businesses or to grow and sustain their existing businesses. "Institutions that wish to partner with us in this empowerment programme are welcome to interact with us. Your financial and non-financial support will be highly appreciated. "We have already partnered with Seda; the Manufacturing, Engineering and Related Services Sector Education and Training Authority; the Forek Institute of Technology, the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition; the National Youth Development Agency; and the National Empowerment Fund. Two of our other major stakeholders in this project include Columbus Stainless and the Mpumalanga Department of Economic Development and Tourism,‚Äù says Mashego.
