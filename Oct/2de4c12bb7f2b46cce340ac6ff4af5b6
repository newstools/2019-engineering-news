South African Airways (SAA) announced on Monday that it had entered into a codesharing agreement with Ghanaian carrier African World Airlines (AWA). The agreement came into effect on Sunday. AWA operates scheduled domestic flights within Ghana and regional flights to and from Nigeria (Lagos and Abuja), Liberia (Monrovia), and Sierra Leone (Freetown). Currently, the codesharing is unilateral. SAA has started marketing AWA services and SAA passengers will be able fly on the AWA routes covered by the agreement, using a single SAA ticket, provided that Johannesburg is on their itinerary. The AWA routes covered by the codesharing are Accra-Kumasi (within Ghana), Accra-Lagos and Accra-Abuja. This agreement follows on from a 2018 interline agreement between the two carriers, which facilitated travel by passengers needing to connect the AWA network with SAA’s operations to Johannesburg or Washington. “South African Airways greatly values our rapidly developing partnership with Africa World Airlines,” said SAA Chief Commercial Officer Philip Saunders. “Our new codeshare agreement opens up new opportunities in West Africa, and offer exciting new services and convenient connections to our customers.” “Africa World Airlines is very pleased to expand our partnership with South African Airways through the introduction of this codeshare agreement,” affirmed AWA Chief Operations Officer Sean Mendis. “This is an important step towards providing passengers even more seamless travel options in the West African region via our hub in Accra.” The agreement with AWA forms part of SAA’s strategy of forging partnerships and collaborations with other airlines, especially in Africa. SAA now has 24 partnerships with airlines around the world. These allow SAA passengers to access destinations not served by the South African carrier. AWA reportedly has a fleet of eight airlines. They are all Embraer ERJ-145 50-seat regional jets.
