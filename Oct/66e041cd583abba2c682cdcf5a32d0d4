No load-shedding was expected for Wednesday after generating plant performance improved and the probability of load-shedding remained low for the rest of the week, Eskom said. "Eskom has not implemented rotational load-shedding for the past ten days and the probability of load-shedding is low for the week," Eskom said. "While the generating plant performance has improved, the plant continues to remain vulnerable and any unexpected shift such as an increase in unplanned breakdowns could result in load-shedding at short notice." The power utility thanked customers for using electricity sparingly and urged people to switch off geysers and all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand. Eskom said it would continue to keep the country informed about the status of the electricity system.
