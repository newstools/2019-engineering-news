From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: Equipment and components manufacturer BMG hosted its food and beverage industry day last month, which was the first of its showcase days that it intends to use to deepen its relations with clients and to highlight the products and solutions suitable for each industry. Schalk Burger has the story. Schalk Burger: BMG has a very wide range of products and catalogues of components, which is reflected in its slogan “part of every process”. However, the diversity of its range means that its clients are not always exposed to or aware of solutions and equipment that are suitable for their respective industries. The company has, therefore, decided to use industry showcase days to focus on portions of its range and to highlight its capabilities to clients. It believes this will improve the value clients get from their purchases and will establish BMG as a trusted supplier and partner for its clients. BMG started with the food and beverage industry, which it sees as a growing market in Africa. The industry must meet stringent, and rising, safety and quality demands. BMG Group product and sales manager Mark Barbour details the objectives of the company’s focused approach. BMG Group product and sales manager Mark Barbour: Sashnee Moodley: Other news making headlines: With stagnant economic growth and an unemployment rate of about 29%, the pressure is increasing on the agricultural sector to contribute more to gross domestic product and live up to its potential in the country.
