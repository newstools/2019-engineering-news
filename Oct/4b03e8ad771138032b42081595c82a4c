The University of Johannesburg (UJ) Business School will, on November 12, host a masterclass, facilitated by Eunomix CEO Claude Baissac, titled ‘Geopolitical and country risk until 2024: How will it impact your business?’. Business leaders rank geopolitical and country risk (GCR) as a key factor impacting on strategy, profitability and continuity. Brexit, the China-US trade war, the Middle East conflict and terrorism in Central and West Africa are all contributing to uncertainty and mounting business disruption. Political risk insurance claims and premiums are at a 30-year high. In South Africa, the poor performance of the economy is undermining business confidence, with the latest xenophobic attacks having directly impacted on some companies and damaged the crucial relationship between Nigeria and South Africa. The masterclass will address global trends in geopolitical and country risk, with a focus on South Africa; how business is impacted by disruption, cost and uncertainty – from direct losses to investment cutback and avoidance; current approaches to GCR management – strengths and weaknesses; and how to initiate the process of risk analysis and reduction in practical and cost-effective ways. It will use current examples of South African businesses, through interaction with workshop participants, to demonstrate the prevalence of GCR in the country’s environment and discuss the efficacy of prevailing approaches.
