The main water pipeline transporting water from George to the Wilderness area has collapsed and fallen into the sea, Western Cape Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning Minister Anton Bredell said on Monday. The pipeline was attached below the existing walkway over the Kaaimans bridge. “Sections of the walkway have become badly rusted over time, which has become unsafe for pedestrian use and, most recently, it appears the structure could no longer support the main water line from George to Wilderness leading to the collapse of the pipeline,” he noted in a water status update. National, provincial and local authorities have been working nonstop to address the situation, Bredell assured, after an investigation revealed the situation over the weekend. “The engineers working on the repair job estimate that an emergency pipeline will be in place by the end of this week. Provincial disaster management is monitoring the situation.” Meanwhile, the City of Cape Town’s dam levels remain above 80%. “The latest average dam levels for the Western Cape is 65.06%, while the largest dam in the province – Theewaterskloof – is at 70.1% full,” he said. However, the drought in other parts of the province continues, with the average level for dams in the Gouritz river catchment area below 19%. This situation is being monitored on an ongoing basis, he concluded.
