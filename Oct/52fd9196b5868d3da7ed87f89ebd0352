Standard Bank has formed a new strategic partnership with the South African Photovoltaic Industry Association (SAPVIA) to advance the growth of the solar photovoltaic (PV) industry in South Africa. Sapvia, representing more than 300 players in the solar PV industry, will leverage the partnership to deliver a number of strategic and support services through the PV GreenCard programme by focusing on skills development, installer accreditation, standardisation and documentation of small-scale solar PV installations. The Standard Bank partnership is expected to engender safe solar installations through the promotion of the adoption of the PV GreenCard, which is the industryâ€™s quality assurance mechanism. While the PV GreenCard programme ensures installers are trained to deliver high-quality, safe and legal solar PV installations, Standard Bank will use the list of accredited installers to ensure the sustainable and responsible growth of the small-scale embedded generation (SSEG) market by offering specialised funding mechanisms and products to project owners and customers alike. Standard Bank natural resources head Berrie de Jager indicates that the bank is committed to the renewables journey and has developed its competencies in the SSEG space to support commercial and industrial clients with bespoke funding structures that suit their specific business needs. The collaboration with SAPVIA on the PV GreenCard is expected to be a pivotal factor in ensuring that the sector develops with the correct regulatory controls being implemented in this space, and in providing the banks clients with peace of mind around the quality of installations being carried out.
