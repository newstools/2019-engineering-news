Embattled construction company Group Five has announced that Dr Thabo Clifford Kogo has resigned as interim CEO, with effect from October 30, in order to pursue an alternative career opportunity. Kogo has served as interim CEO to the group since February, shortly before the company was placed into business rescue. Subsequent to the approval of the business rescue plan, on September 11, the business rescue practitioners (BRPs) are now implementing the approved plan. Under the circumstances, the BRPs have advised that a replacement CEO will not be appointed at this time.
