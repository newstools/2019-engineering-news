JSE-listed Redefine Properties’ COO David Rice will retire on August 31, 2020, after more than a decade of service. Rice has been responsible for helping drive leasing and asset improvement goals for the company and has over 30 years’ experience in the property sector, the real estate investment trust said on Monday. To ensure business and operational continuity and enable a structured handover, Redefine has confirmed that the search for a successor “has begun in earnest”. The announcement clears the path for the succession processes to unfold, as well as allow Rice to hand over responsibilities once the new COO has been appointed.
