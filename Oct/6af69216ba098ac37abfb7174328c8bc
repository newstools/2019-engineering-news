The Institute for Timber Construction South Africa (ITC-SA) has reversed its resolution of dormancy following overwhelming feedback from various quarters of the structural timber industry, the full spectrum of its membership and government departments, on the critical role that the institute has played – and should continue to play – in South Africa’s engineered timber construction industry. In view of this indication of support for the continuance of the ITC-SA, along with numerous proposals for continuing the institute’s functioning, an extraordinary board meeting was held on October 16 to collate this feedback and investigate a possible turnaround strategy. After extensive deliberation, the current board resolved to continue until a workable and enforceable model, which will ensure the practical and effective regulation and promotion of the engineered timber construction industry, is developed. This model is to be presented to a special general meeting of its members, where a new board will be elected to accurately reflect the membership and incorporate key role-players in the engineered timber construction industry. As such, the ITC-SA’s resolution for dormancy is reversed, subject to the introduction of a sustainable funding model and an avenue for introducing compulsory membership, as well as certain restrictions relating to the position of chairperson. Discussions with key industry stakeholders are under way to pave the way for a practical, effective and sustainable way forward to ensure the continuation of the ITC-SA’s role in safeguarding the engineered timber construction industry in South Africa. Regional branch meetings have been scheduled for Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal to gather further insights and suggestions from the institute’s members. Members are encouraged to use this opportunity to have their say and actively influence the future of the ITC-SA and the wider industry.
