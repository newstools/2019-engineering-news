Mpumalanga Health MEC Sasekani Manzini earlier this week handed over 35 new ambulances to the province's emergency services, as well as 15 bakkies to the Forensic Pathology Services. "The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is one of the three core pillars of health service delivery, standing as it does alongside primary healthcare and hospital services," she said, adding that the EMS was crucial in ensuring “a long and healthy life for all South Africans". “It should be noted that over 84% of our people rely on our public healthcare facilities for their good health and we have a responsibility to ensure that our people receive quality healthcare. "The 35 new ambulances and the 15 pick-up bakkies that we are unveiling will improve our ability to come to the aid of the people in emergency situations within a reasonable time including far-flung areas where the terrain is rough,” added Manzini.
