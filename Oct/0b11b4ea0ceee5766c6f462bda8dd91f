Go Life International has made changes to its board, restructured its management team and refocused its business strategy. Gerhard Naude has stepped down as group CEO, effective October 10, and will now serve on the company’s board as key group adviser. He will also chair the board’s strategic business direction division. The main reason for his departure is to direct his attention to the intended listing of the medicinal cannabis special purpose vehicle (SPV), Go Canna Africa (GCA), on another stock exchange in due course. GCA will be re-incorporated into the larger Go Life structure once the legalities are settled with medicinal cannabis in Mauritius. Mxolisi Motau will take over as the new Go Life group CEO. A renewed focus on the core business of Go Life necessitated the strategic aligning of some divisions in the group. To this end, the property division of Bon Healthcare is to be moved into a subsidiary SPV.
