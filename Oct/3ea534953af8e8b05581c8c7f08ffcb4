The Institute for Timber Construction South Africa (ITC-SA) has announced that it will enter dormancy as of November 1. The ITC-SA was established more than 45 years ago to help formalise and advance the timber roof construction industry and protect consumers and is South Africa’s professional body for the engineered timber construction industry. Following a recent board meeting, in Isando, the resolution was formally agreed upon and comes on the back of protracted talks with various stakeholders regarding sustainable funding avenues to support the work of the ITC-SA into the future. “In the past, a compulsory membership system was in place, whereby all licensed fabricators were required to hold membership with the ITC-SA to ensure the continued self-regulation of the engineered timber construction industry in South Africa,” ITC-SA GM Amanda Obbes says. However, she explains that, over the past two years, this membership has become voluntary. Coupled with a struggling economy, this has sent member support in this critical field into decline, she laments. Without the full support of all stakeholders, the ITC-SA is unable to “adequately serve its membership as it has done in the past, through technical standards, auditing and inspection procedures and processes developed over the past 46 years,” she notes. “This resolution comes as a major blow, not only to the institute as a critical and essential custodian of the engineered timber construction sector, but to its many members who actively pursue excellence in the built environment through world-class timber construction, roofing and decking,” she laments. However, Obbes notes that timber construction remains a viable and intelligent choice in roofing and construction, although without an entity enforcing high standards and protecting the consumer, “the future of quality timber roofing and construction in South Africa is uncertain”.
