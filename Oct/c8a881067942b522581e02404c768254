Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has noted the directive of Cabinet on the matter of the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project (GFIP), which incorporates electronic tolling (e-tolls). Cabinet noted the options considered by the task team appointed by the President Cyril Ramaphosa, comprising Mbalula as the chairperson, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and Gauteng Premier David Makhura. Having duly noted the options presented, Cabinet this week resolved that further work be undertaken in answering to the challenges posed by the options identified. The task team will explore the directives of Cabinet, continue engaging stakeholders and report back. Mbalula will communicate the details once the process has been finalised. Cabinet held a meeting on Wednesday in Cape Town. At a media briefing following this, on Thursday, Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu indicated that the matter of e-tolls was before Cabinet currently, and had yet to be concluded. Mbalula was due to address the media on e-tolls on Thursday evening.
