Swiss International Airlines is providing enhanced customer benefits and traveller comforts for South African passengers travelling to Zurich on its newly revamped Airbus A340. The company on Friday gave a media tour of one of its revamped A340s, at OR Tambo International Airport. The Airbus A340 is part of the long-haul fleet that will service the Zurich–Johannesburg route. The airline is in the process of revamping its fleet of five Airbus A340s. Three have already been completed and the remaining two are set to be completed by the winter. Swiss indicated that, with flying becoming a commodity, the airline set itself apart by focusing on enhancing the little things. The improved models feature completely new first, second and third class areas, WiFi connectivity on board as part of the inflight entertainment system, modern interiors and different light settings for different times of the flight. In economy class, notable features include extra legroom, and a specially designed seat cushion that Swiss partnered with a local start-up to design. This is made with a special technology that aims to provide user comfort and remove discomfort often associated with sitting for long periods. Business class has both single and couple seating arrangements, with benefits including a massaging chair, a fully reclining seat and a divider option between shared seats. First class provides single or couple seating as well, designer cosmetics bags for both males and females, pyjamas from a notable manufacture in Switzerland, slippers, an adjustable seatbed, a wide screen and an option for dining tables for those travelling together. The seat cushions in both business and first class were designed with air in the middle, to enable maximum comfort that fits to the person’s shape and seating positions.
