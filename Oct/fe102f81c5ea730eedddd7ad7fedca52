Systems and solutions provider for aseptic packaging and filling machines for food and beverages, SIG Combibloc Obeikan (SIG CBOB), and South African producer and distributor of branded food and beverage products, Pioneer Foods, on Monday announced the launch of the first combismile carton pack in the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region. SIG developed combismile – a packaging solution for on-the-go consumption that offers volume and design flexibility – as well as the drinksplus option that gives additional health and nutritional value to beverages by adding fruit or vegetable particulates. With its curved shape and easy-grip corners, it allows for convenient consumption from the pack with a single-action closure that is leak-proof and tamper-evident. Further, combismile is created using only paperboard made of pulp from trees from Forest Stewardship Council-certified, responsibly managed forests and other controlled sources. SIG CBOB CEO Abdelghany Eladib said the MEA region’s population was undergoing a major shift in demographics and rapid urbanisation, with consumer spending in Africa projected to reach $2.1-trillion by 2025. “These strong structural fundamentals are driving consumer demand in the food and beverages sector. On-the-go consumption is the new trend in the ever-changing fast consumer lifestyles. The differentiation, the volume and product flexibility of the combismile pack makes it an attractive solution for our partner to respond to regional market needs.”
