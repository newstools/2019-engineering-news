Strides have been made in improving gender inclusivity in the workplace and the corporate world is becoming ever more cognisant of the need for greater diversity; however, there are still challenges to be overcome, a panel of speakers at the Deloitte Alchemy School of Management’s Wonder Women in Leadership speaker series highlighted on Friday. Identity Partners founder and principal partner Sonja de Bruyn commented that, in her experience and field, boards were becoming more gender sensitive and inclusive and were starting to understand the importance of adhering to the "30% club". However, she pointed out that questions had to be asked in other areas, including about fair and equal remuneration, as well as diversity in management teams. She pointed out that South Africa started having the conversation about gender diversity before many other markets, as a result of women being included in the transformation policy adopted by the country after the 1994 democratic elections. “The policy environment in South Africa is fairly robust. The question is whether we are using these levers and tools to advance the diversity agenda,” she said. Pekao International president Roksana Ciurysek, meanwhile, touched on the change in attitude women had to undergo to ensure greater gender diversity. She stated that many women did not feel ready for higher roles or promotions, whereas male counterparts tended to find it easier to seize opportunities. She encouraged women to not be scared to take a seat at the table. Further, Vodacom Digital Channels managing executive Priya Thakoor commented that women were severely underrepresented in the technology sector, as a result of few women studying the subjects required to enter the sector. She too reiterated that policy in South Africa was conducive to gender inclusivity, but that implementation of such policy within companies had to be fast-tracked.
