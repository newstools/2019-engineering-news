Law firm ENSafrica has assisted information technology services company EOH in initial criminal charges against former employees implicated in alleged wrongdoing. JSE-listed EOH in July reported that preliminary findings of a forensic investigation undertaken by ENSafrica had uncovered R1.2-billion of bribery, corruption and inflated payments, mainly involving eight former EOH head office employees and the companyâ€™s public sector subsidiary EOH Mthombo. In addition to the criminal charges, EOH will seek to recover losses as a result of the alleged wrongdoing. The company has indicated that it would make further information about the anticipated financial impact of the investigation findings available to shareholders on October 15, when it expects to release its 2019 financial year results.
