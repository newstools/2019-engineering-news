The Faculty of Engineering at Stellenbosch University recently received confirmation that the new BEng degree in Data Engineering will be fully accredited by the Engineering Council of South Africa (ECSA) for registration as a professional engineer. The ECSA-accredited degree will also be accepted in a number of other countries, including the US, Canada, the UK, Singapore, Japan, New Zealand and Australia, as the required academic qualification for registration as a professional engineer. This degree will be a specialisation stream in its existing undergraduate degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, the BEng (E&E). The purpose of this new specialisation in Data Engineering is to prepare engineers for the Fourth Industrial Revolution where the world of work has fundamentally changed and there is a deluge of data that needs to be structured, modelled and analysed to enable data-led organisations to discover the underlying knowledge and make well-informed decisions. There are still a limited number of places available for first-year students who want to enrol for this new degree in 2020. Prospective students interested in pursuing a career in Data Engineering are encouraged to directly contact the chair of the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Professor Herman Engelbrecht, at ee@sun.ac.za or on 021 808 2139. Only learners with a sustained distinction in mathematics will be considered at this late stage.
