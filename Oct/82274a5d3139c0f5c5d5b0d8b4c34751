The Western Cape government on Monday reported that the latest average dam level for the Western Cape was 64.1%, compared with 65.7% at the same time last year. Western Cape Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC Anton Bredell said dam levels in the interior parts of the province continued to be low and were being monitored on an ongoing basis. Meanwhile, the Western Cape confirmed that water challenges in the Wilderness area, in the Southern Cape, had been resolved. The main water pipeline that provides water from George to Wilderness collapsed and fell into the sea earlier this month, owing to badly rusted sections of the pipeline. National, provincial and local government, as well as State-owned utility Transnet worked for the last eight days to put a new pipe section in place and restore water to the community. Bredell said government would continue to monitor the fixed pipeline to ensure it performs as expected.
