State-owned Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) on Tuesday started the planned maintenance shutdown of its agriculture and bulk liquids (ABL) business unit. The shutdown will be concluded on October 28 and will affect the rail network from East London to Cathcart, Burgersdorp to Noupoort and Springfontein to Trompsburg. The maintenance will include the replacement of 26 m of track cable, 100 m of jumper cable, 41 signal units and two finger points contact machines. The shutdown will also allow for the rehabilitation of the formation at the Tylden and Lower incline, the installation of thousands of sleepers, the tamping of 45 km of track and the refurbishment of Tunnel 11, besides other activities. TFR said the maintenance work will result in increased network availability.
