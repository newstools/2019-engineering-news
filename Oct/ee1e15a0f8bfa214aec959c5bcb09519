The European Union (EU) agreed to grant the UK a three-month Brexit delay to January 31, removing the risk of a damaging no-deal split on Thursday as the British government tries to end the impasse in Parliament. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is pushing a vote in the House of Commons on Monday to trigger an early general election, saying it’s the only way to resolve the deadlock that has stopped the UK ratifying the divorce deal with Brussels and prolonged the uncertainty for businesses as Brexit drags on. Envoys representing the 27 remaining EU member States agreed to the UK request for a Brexit extension to January 31, EU Council president Donald Tusk said on Twitter. The bloc’s decision will be formalised “through a written procedure,” Tusk said, meaning that there will be no leaders’ summit. The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told reporters the diplomats’ meeting was “very short, effective and constructive” as he left the room.
