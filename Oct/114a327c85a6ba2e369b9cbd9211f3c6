State-owned freight utility Transnet on Wednesday announced two fatalities and two severe injuries after a head-on collision between two trains at the Matlabas crossing, which is located between Thabazimbi and Lephalale, in Limpopo. The collision happened on Tuesday evening between a train with 100 loaded coal wagons and a stationary train with 89 empty wagons. The train driver and assistant train driver of the empty train were fatally injured, while the driver and assistant driver from the loaded train were severely injured and taken to a nearby hospital. Transnet could preliminarily report that the empty train set had two burnt out locomotives and one derailed on its side. The utility stated that the line would be closed until further notice, while recovery teams were on site to clear the scene and carry out repairs to damaged infrastructure. Meanwhile, engineers and senior management members were working on a line investigation to determine the cause of the accident. Transnet said a board of inquiry would be set up by an independent arbiter.
