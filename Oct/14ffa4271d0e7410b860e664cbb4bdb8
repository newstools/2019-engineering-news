Property firm Atterbury Property is making its first foray into shared workspaces with its new Attspace co-working concept, which debuted at the La Gratitude Manor House on Stellenbosch’s historic oak-lined Dorp street. “Attspace is Atterbury’s first venture into the exciting world of co-working. We are experimenting with the concept at our Stellenbosch property and, based on its success, intend to expand our unique vision for shared offices into other areas of South Africa,” said Attspace leasing manager Jackie Raubenheimer in a statement released on Monday. Attspace offers high-speed uncapped fibre Internet, personal lockers, network printing, boardrooms, a lounge, a fully equipped kitchenette with free coffee, daily cleaning, shower facilities and two relaxing patios. Security includes biometrics and a security application which also enables 24/7 access for working any time of the day or night. The shared offices enjoy the convenience of La Gratitude’s Italian restaurant, Asta La Pasta, and is within walking distance of restaurant and retail offerings. The Attspace 15-seater open-plan shared workspace is a business address suited to a diverse variety of users, from entrepreneurs and start-ups to freelancers and small business owners. Personalised packages are available to users’ requirements. Atterbury renovated La Gratitude and repurposed it into a 1 000 m2 of office space and a 200 m2 restaurant. Atterbury occupies the first floor of La Gratitude, and joins a number of other businesses already occupying the building.
