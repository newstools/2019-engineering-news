Public transport in the country is not performing effectively, efficiently and to its full potential, owing to the various modes of public transport not being integrated. This was indicated by a representative from the Department of Transport during a Transport Forum discussion on bus-rapid transit systems, held in Johannesburg this week. Therefore, to ensure a safe, efficient and comfortable transport journey for commuters, the representative emphasised the need for all spheres of government to pursue greater integration of the various modes of transport. Moreover, there was a need to optimise the current resources made available for the roll-out of public transport projects.
