Personalised shared transport service, Zeelo, in partnership with Eastgate Shopping Centre and Sandton City Shopping Centre, is set to launch a commuting service between the East Rand and Sandton hubs on November 4. Shoppers and commuters will be able to choose between four morning departure times from Eastgate Shopping Centre and four afternoon return times from Sandton, with a single return ticket at R75, with the price including free parking. Several bulk ride packages are also available at discounted rates. Zeelo will make use of luxury, air-conditioned coaches, with reclining seats, with the vehicles also equipped with complimentary WiFi. “We at Zeelo are passionate about giving people their time back,” says Zeelo South Africa GM James Champion. “The average commuter that drives to work in their car wastes up to thirteen weeks a year behind the steering wheel. We want to make traveling with Zeelo a viable alternative to a car.” For every Zeelo journey from Eastgate Shopping Centre to Sandton City, an average of 30 vehicles will be taken off the road, contributing to a reduction in traffic congestion, as well as carbon emissions, notes Champion. Passengers wishing to use the service will be able to book and pay for their rides online through Zeelo’s website. They will have access to 24/7 live customer support through an online live chat functionality, and will also be able to track their bus in real time. Zeelo, founded in 2017, is based in the UK, with South Africa its first overseas market launch.
