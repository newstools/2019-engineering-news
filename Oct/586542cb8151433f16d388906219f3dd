On an operating performance basis, business unit operating profit before depreciation and amortisation increased by 4% to R118.9-million. Gross profit for the period increased from R360.5-million to R390.8-million, while the group’s gross margin increased to 34.4% from 31.4% last year. Jasco’s net operating margin of 1% was down on last year's 4%, mostly owing to one-off head office costs and impairments of goodwill and loans to associates. Revenue was flat at R1.14-billion. Management implemented a number of corrective actions during the year, which impacted profitability, the company said in a statement. “Jasco's working capital management remained an area of focus during the year, with a pleasing reduction in short-term receivables and payables,” it said. “The statement of cash flows reflects an inflow in cash generated from operations before working capital changes of R75.8-million, compared with R94.4-million in 2018.”
