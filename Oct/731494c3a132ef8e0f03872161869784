Aim-listed Ncondezi Energy has appointed Christ Schutte interim COO. His main responsibility will be to lead the technical process on the company’s integrated 300 MW coal-fired power station and coal mine project, in Tete, Mozambique. This includes management of the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) and operations and management (O&M) processes with the company's strategic partners, which is due to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of this year. Schutte has considerable knowledge of the business, having been a nonexecutive director of Ncondezi from February 2013. He also recently worked for South African power utility Eskom. "Chris's appointment as COO comes at an important time as the company seeks to reinforce its in-house technical expertise and ramp up its project development programme with its strategic partners. “He is uniquely positioned to drive key technical processes with his in-depth knowledge of the project and experience operating some of the largest coal-fired power plants on the continent. This is a critical appointment to achieve the best results from the EPC and O&M bid process, allowing for the delivery of a competitive tariff to EDM,” comments Ncondezi CEO Hanno Pengilly.
