Construction has started on the first phase of the multibillion-rand Castle Gate mixed-use precinct in Pretoria. The precinct is being co-developed by Atterbury Property Fund (APF) and The Carl Erasmus Trust. APF is co-owned by property developer and investor Atterbury, its management and founders, as well as Talis Investment Partners. The large-scale, multifaceted development will eventually comprise 100 000 m2 of office space, 40 000 m2 of specialist medical facilities, a hotel, 1 100 residential units and the 23 000 m2 Castle Gate Lifestyle Centre. The Castle Gate Lifestyle Centre, which is already under construction, makes up the first phase of the overall precinct to be developed. The convenience centre will open in September 2020 and include retail space, medical consulting rooms, offices and a gym. The Castle Gate precinct will also include 8 ha of protected green areas that will incorporate walking and running trails. Construction on the second phase of the precinct will start in mid-2020 and its full development will be completed over the next decade. Upon completion, the Castle Gate project is expected to represent a total investment of R6-billion and 20 000 permanent jobs will have been created as a result of its development. “Castle Gate is a once-in-a-lifetime development opportunity with an excellent location in a key growth node and a unique proposition that has the support of its city and is being welcomed by its community. “For successful property development and investment, it is necessary to look through the short-term cycles and take a long-term view. We are confident in the future of South Africa and proud to invest in the country that we love and the City of Tshwane where Atterbury started. We are thrilled to be working with great partners and believe that this project will have a massive positive impact that creates meaningful value," says Atterbury development manager Raoul de Villiers.
