Emerging natural gas and helium producer Renergen, which is headed up by CEO Stefano Marani, has confirmed that drilling at its Virginia gas project, in South Africa, is on schedule and “making good progress”. The project’s drilling contractor Bohrmeister Technik has partially completed the vertical section and has reached a total vertical depth of 145 m, the company says. Additionally, Renergen says the Bohrmeister team is focused on completing the surface section, which includes casing, logging, cementation and pressure testing on site. The next phase of drilling, which is planned to start this coming Saturday, will see the mobilisation of the horizontal directional drilling rig, which will see a string of 1.5 km long being drilled into the sandstone to intercept the gas-bearing structures within the two primary target zones, namely the upper Vryheid Formation sandstones and the Dwyka Group diamictite.
