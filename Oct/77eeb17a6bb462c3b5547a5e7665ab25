The establishment of the Tshwane Automotive Special Economic Zone (SEZ) will – “without a doubt” – aid in job creation and economic growth, says Gauteng Economic Development, Environment, Agriculture and Rural Development MEC Morakane Mosupyoe. The proposed SEZ will be developed on 162 ha of land in Silverton, in the east of the City of Tshwane. The hub will focus on automotive component manufacturing, and should cater for what is believed to be significant further capacity expansion at the nearby Ford plant. The establishment of the SEZ is currently the focus of a public consultation process, set to end on November 1. Upon conclusion of this process, a report will be submitted to the Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition Ebrahim Patel for final consideration. 
 
“The automotive sector has been one of the most visible sectors receiving foreign investments, and this SEZ provides the necessary impetus for attracting both foreign and domestic direct investments into the economy,” adds Mosupyoe. “These investments could potentially trigger other sectors of the economy . . . and promote innovation.”
 
Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (DTIC) special economic zones chief director Maoto Molefane says the SEZ programme is one of the prioritised tools government is using to attract investment into the country. He says the proposed Tshwane Automotive SEZ will help the country in attracting new automotive component manufacturers, while also strengthening the City of Tshwane’s position as an automotive city.
 
“The proposed zone will contribute significantly towards Gauteng’s reindustrialisation agenda. “This initiative will also bring a lot of opportunities, such as jobs, small business support and skills development, to the surrounding community and the people of Gauteng.”
 
The automotive hub will be developed through a joint partnership between the City of Tshwane, Gauteng Provincial Government and the DTIC.
