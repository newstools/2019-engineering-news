JSE-listed Allied Electronics (Altron) has been appointed Microsoft’s licensing solution provider (LSP) in South Africa. The move is in line with Altron’s ambitions of positioning its recently acquired subsidiary Altron Karabina as the “go-to partner for everything Microsoft”, says Altron Group CEO Mteto Nyati. “Customers invest in technology to increase sales; improve operational efficiencies; transform customer and employee experience; and drive innovation. Altron Karabina will help them extract business value quicker,” he adds. The LSP licence will enable Altron Karabina to launch its software services division, adding to its Microsoft competencies in data and analytics, artificial intelligence, customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning, modern workplace, Azure and DevOps, notes Altron Karabina MD Grant van der Wal. “We will offer consumption billing to our customers as they unlock the strategic value delivered through the cloud. The new software services team will work closely with the consulting services team to serve customers in the best way possible,” he says. Through subsidiary Bytes UK, Altron is Microsoft’s biggest LSP partner in the UK, a position the technology company plans to extend to South Africa, with Altron Karabina working closely with Bytes UK to duplicate their success locally.
