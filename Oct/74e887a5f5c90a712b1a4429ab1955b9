KwaZulu-Natal Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube believes building a cable car in the Drakensberg will help boost tourism and contribute to growing the provincial economy. She referred to the Drakensberg mountain as a "must see". “We are happy to announce the cable car project as it is one of the most iconic projects in the province's history," she said, adding that the project would showcase the range of tourism activities available in the Drakensberg region, including skiing, ziplining and water activities. "The Drakensberg mountain's scenic beauty is only appreciated when you see it from the top; hence, we felt the need to establish the cable car as it will excite our visitors and we want every member of society to share the mind-blowing experience there,” said Dube-Ncube. She pointed out that the project would also contribute to job creation for people living near the Drakensberg mountain.
