The Competition Tribunal will hear evidence in the cement industry cartel case, when the matter resumes in Pretoria, on Thursday. The case stems from a Competition Commission investigation, which probed alleged collusive conduct in the cement industry against Natal Portland Cement Cimpor (NPC), Pretoria Portland Cement Company (PPC), Lafarge Industries South Africa and AfriSam Consortium. Despite not seeking any relief against PPC, AfriSam or Lafarge, the commission referred a case of indirect price fixing and market division to the tribunal against NPC. PPC was granted conditional leniency in terms of the commissionâ€™s corporate leniency policy, while AfriSam settled with the commission and paid an administrative penalty of almost R125-million. Lafarage also settled with the commission and paid an administrative penalty of almost R149-million.
