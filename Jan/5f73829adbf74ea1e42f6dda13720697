Environmental Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane will host, on January 10 and 11, the Partnership for Action on the Green Economy (Page) Ministerial conference at the Cape Town International Convention Centre. She said in a statement issued on Tuesday that hosting the Page conference would advance the agenda of inclusive growth and the adoption of a low-carbon and climate resilient economy, domestically and on the African continent. South Africa joined the global Page programme in 2015, following the identification of potential to enhance multilateralism and support for climate action. In 2016, the programme started and should be implemented for a period of three years, with a sustainability close-out phase by 2020. The Page programme in South Africa aims to strengthen the cooperation, coordination and capabilities required by South Africa to implement the transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient and pro-employment development path. Cabinet in September 2017 approved the hosting of the Page conference by South Africa. The conference supports countries and regions to put sustainability at the heart of economic policies and practices to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The conference will share the latest thinking and evidence on four thematic themes including green finance, strategies and policies for a green economy, social and economic inclusion, and sustainable consumption and production and the circular economy. This will be the third time the conference is hosted, following two successful conferences â€“ Dubai, in 2014, and Berlin, in 2017. Speakers will include International Labour Organisation director-general Guy Ryder, Amnesty International secretary general Kumi Naidoo and more than 15 Ministers or Deputy Ministers of environment, finance and industry from around the world.
