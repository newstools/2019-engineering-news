Global medical device manufacturer Zimmer Biomet has appointed property and construction solutions company Profica to provide tenant representation and office fitout for a warehouse and office building that Zimmer will occupy. The building is currently under development at the Waterfall Distribution Campus, in Midrand. Profica is required to monitor and review the construction programme throughout the build phase through to tenant installation, and ensure consistent information flow between Zimmer and the landlord. Additionally, Profica is providing move management and interior design facilitation, ensuring the specific requirements of multiple stakeholders within the Zimmer organisation are incorporated into the design plans, said Profica senior project manager Willie Knoetze. Moreover, Profica will undertake sequency of occupancy, which requires intricate programming to ensure the tenant’s fitout, which includes the installation and delivery of furniture, falls within the landlord’s construction programme. The building project started in September 2018, with leasing scheduled to start in early June.
