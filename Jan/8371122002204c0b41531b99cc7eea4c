Metrobus management on Tuesday apologised to commuters after the second day of industrial action, led by Democratic Municipal & Allied Workers Union of South Africa (Demawusa), shut down the bus service in the city of Cape Town. Metrobus said it was working hard to find a lasting solution to the bus driver strike to ensure that services returned to normality as a matter of urgency. "Service disruptions, due to industrial action Metrobus has in the past two days experienced difficulties ferrying thousands of commuter from various parts of the city," Metrobus spokesperson Goodwill Shivuri said in a statement posted on the Metrobus Twitter page. "This is as a result of an industrial action led by Demawusa." Shivuri said management had been negotiating with the union to resolve the stand off, but DemawusaÂ was adamant that the strike would continue until all their demands were met. "Much progress has been made since the negotiations started, of 44 demands placed on the table, over 60% has been agreed upon and a possible solution is imminent. "The strike is at the detriment of commuters who depend on public transportation to get to work and schools," Shivuri said. Metrobus said that non-striking workers were not able to work because of "minor acts of intimidation" from striking workers leading to a complete shutdown of the bus service provider. Metrobus apologised for the inconvenience caused to commuters as a result of the industrial action and advised commuters to make alternative travel arrangements while the company was trying to resolve the impasse.
