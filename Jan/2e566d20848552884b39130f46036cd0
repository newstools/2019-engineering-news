Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, who will deliver the 2019 Budget on February 20 in Cape Town, has called on South Africans to send him and his team ideas on how South Africa can boost its economic growth. The economy is expected to grow by only 0.7% in 2018, according to the latest estimates of the South African Reserve Bank, well below the 5% annual growth called for in the National Development Plan. Treasury said in a statement on Thursday that Mboweni would like to hear from South Africans about how the country can achieve faster and more equitable growth, and what government can do differently to grow the economy. Treasury asked South Africans to send tweets to @TreasuryRSA with the hashtag #TipsForMinFin and #RSABudget2019, or use the Budget Tips form on the www.treasury.gov.za website.
