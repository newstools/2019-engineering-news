A man was electrocuted on top of a train travelling from Philippi to Cape Town early on Wednesday morning, Metrorail Western Cape has confirmed.

"This has resulted in Chris Hani trains terminating at Philippi until the line is declared safe for operations," she told News24.

"Commuters are advised to find alternative transport between Chris Hani and Philippi as bus operators are unable to assist during peak."

An inquest docket is under investigation.
