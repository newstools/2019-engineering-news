Integrated transport systems provider Alstom and APIX, the agency responsible for the promotion of investment and major works in Senegal, this week celebrated the first voyage of the Coradia Polyvalent train, in Dakar. The event took place in the presence of Senegal President Macky Sall and Alstom Central and North Africa MD Raphaël Bernadelli. APIX in 2016 awarded Alstom a contract for the supply of 15 regional trains. The first Coradia train for Senegal was successfully received by the customer last September at the Alstom site in Reichshoffen, France, where it is manufactured. Since then, three trains have been shipped to Dakar. The trains will run on the new line linking the centre of Dakar to the Blaise Diagne International Airport in Diass. They will transport about 115 000 passengers a day along a 55 km rail line that includes 14 rail stations. “We are honoured to participate today in the inauguration of this first Coradia Polyvalent train for Senegal. Thanks to the confidence of our customer APIX and the contribution of all Alstom employees, we are proud to place Dakar among the first cities in Africa to acquire such transport technology and, thus, provide passengers in this country with a safe, reliable and environment-friendly mobility solution,” said Bernadelli. The Coradia Polyvalent train for Senegal is a dual-mode electric and diesel train and can travel at speeds of 160 km/h. Each train is 72 m long and includes four cars, providing the capacity for 400 passengers and includes a first and second class. Suited to the climatic and environmental conditions of the country, the train is equipped with an efficient air conditioning system and its low floor facilitates access and movement on board, particularly for passengers with reduced mobility. Coradia Polyvalent belongs to Alstom’s Coradia range of modular trains.
