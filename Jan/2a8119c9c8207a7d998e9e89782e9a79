Egypt plans to upgrade six oil refineries at a cost of about $9-billion over four years to increase domestic production to 41-million tonnes a year, the petroleum minister said. "We are trying to secure crude oil supplies for Egyptian refineries to increase local production of refined products," the minister, Tarek El Molla, said during a conference in Cairo late on Sunday night, without giving further details. Egypt currently has eight refineries with a capacity of 38-million tonnes, of which only 25-million tonnes are utilised.
