The Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has concluded an agreement with Bidfreight Port Operations (BPO) for the design, development, financing, construction, operation, maintenance and transfer of a multipurpose terminal at Sheds 10 and 11 in the Port of Port Elizabeth, following an open tender process. “We are extremely excited that the agreement with BPO has been concluded and that we can welcome a world-class independent operator to the port,” TNPA COO Nozipho Mdawe said on Tuesday, adding that the development would optimise the use of Sheds 10 and 11, and give the port “an edge in the competition” for import and export cargo for Southern Africa. BPO MD Jannie Roux said that although BPO was an independent operator with a reputation built on delivering holistic solutions that ensure the movement and storage of client goods is managed professionally and timeously, the company “continually strives to meet and surpass the values encompassed in its motto: In place. On time”. Although the official ceremony took place on Tuesday, the agreement was concluded towards the end of last year. The refurbishment of Sheds 10 and 11 started in November 2018 and the facility is expected to be fully operational by September 2019. With the overall multipurpose cargo demand projections for South Africa, and the much-required undercover storage infrastructure close to the quayside to support this, the facility will play a vital role in growing the volume of multipurpose cargo passing through the Port of Port Elizabeth, boosting the economy of the region.
