South Africa’s national water level average continues to trend downwards, despite the rain in some parts of the country, from 63.6% last week to 62.9% this week. A weekly dam levels report resulted in the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) urging consumers to intensify their water conservation efforts to “save the country from a dry winter”. The Western Cape’s dam levels remain at dire water levels, registering at only 47.9%, as the water levels of the Theewaterskloof dam decreased from 47.4% last week to 46.3% this week. The Voelsvlei dam recorded 75.4%, while the Clanwilliam dam water levels decreased from 57.6% to 54% week-on-week. In the North West, average water levels ticked up from 57.5% to 57.7%, despite a drastic decline in the Potchefstroom dam levels to 88.5%, the Boskop dam to 64.6% and Taung dam to 82.3%. KwaZulu-Natal’s Umgeni System, which comprises Albert Falls, Nagle and Inanda dams, dropped fractionally to 59.2%, while the Midmar dam in Natal Midlands and the Inanda dam both decreased marginally to 93.3% and 61.1%, respectively, this week. Eastern Cape dams also recorded decreases week-on-week, registering at 56% this week, compared with 57.4% the week before. “Of particular concern is Makhanda dam in Makhanda which has almost dried up. This has led to fears that the area may be without water by mid-February. However, the DWS has partnered with the Makhanda municipality and the provincial government to obviate a total disaster,” the DWS said in its weekly dam levels report on Wednesday. However, the Nahoon dam increased from 67.6% to 68.1%, while Bridle Drift increased from 44.3% to 48.9%. The Algoa Water Supply System decreased from 50% to 48.9%. Meanwhile, in Gauteng, the Vaal dam water levels decreased from 74.1% recorded last week to 73.1%. The Integrated Vaal River System decreased from 69.2% to 68.8%, compared with 72.3% at the same time last year. In the Free State, the dams decreased to 71.5% this week, while the provincial dam levels of the Northern Cape sat at 68.8% this week and Limpopo’s dam decreased marginally to 59.8%. The dam levels in Mpumalanga were maintained mostly at around 67.8%.
