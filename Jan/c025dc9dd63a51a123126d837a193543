The water levels across the 14 dams forming part of the Integrated Vaal River System (IVRS) continue to decline. A Department of Water and Sanitation statement on Thursday indicates that the high temperatures and above normal water use in recent days have resulted in a decrease in water levels to 69.7% this week, compared with 73.2% in the corresponding week last year. However, this is slightly up on the 69.2% recorded last week. The Vaal dam increased from 74% last week to 75.2% this week – slightly lower than the dam levels of 80.4% in the same week last year. The Grootdraai dam’s levels increased to 76% this week, from 73.3% last week. The dam was 101.5% full in the comparative period last year. The Sterkfontein dam is marginally lower this week, at 94%, compared with last week’s 94.1% and the 94.2% recorded for the same period in 2018. The Bloemhof dam edged up from 61.1% last week to 61.8% this week, but remains lower than the 76.8% reported during the comparative week a year ago. Meanwhile, the Mohale dam remains stagnant at 40.8%, along with the Katse dam, which stands at 18.2%.
