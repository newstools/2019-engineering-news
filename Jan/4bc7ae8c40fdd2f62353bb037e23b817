Rand Water on Wednesday said it had reduced water pressure to two Mpumalanga-based local municipalities owing to the nonpayment of fees. The Victor Khanye and Govan Mbeki local municipalities have allegedly failed to honour agreements made to settle the outstanding amounts due to Rand Water. The water pressure to the Victor Khanye municipality, which includes areas such as Delmas, Botleng, Eloff and Sundra, has been reduced by 60%, while the water pressure to the Govan Mbeki municipality, comprising areas such as Bethal, Embalenhle, Leandra and Kinross, has been reduced by 40%. The Victor Khanye municipality owes around R85.9-million and Govan Mbeki R87.7-million, both due by January 31. “Rand Water has implemented these credit control actions to compel the municipalities to meet their obligations to settle amounts due for water services rendered,” the water agency said in a statement.
