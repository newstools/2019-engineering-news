The Clough Salini Joint Venture (JV) has been selected as the preferred tenderer for about A$4-billion worth of civil works packages for the Snowy 2.0 project – a multiyear pumped-hydro expansion project, in New South Wales, Australia. Clough is a wholly owned subsidiary of Murray & Roberts and has a 35% shareholding in the JV. Snowy 2.0 will expand the generation capacity of Snowy Hydro's Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme by 2 000 MW, with the first power from the expanded project expected in late 2024. The project will link two existing Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme dams – Tantangara and Talbingo – through underground tunnels and an underground power station with pumping capabilities. The power station will comprise six reversible Francis pump-turbine and motor-generator units. "The group’s strategy to extend Murray & Roberts’ Oil & Gas platform’s service offering to complementary markets with active investment programmes is of critical importance, considering the current lack of project opportunities in the Australasian liquefied natural gas sector. "Salini and its US affiliate Lane, are world leaders in hydropower developments, which combined with Clough, creates a JV capability that will deliver the project for the benefit of the Australian community," Murray & Roberts said in a statement issued on Friday.
