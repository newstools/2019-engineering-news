The United National Transport Union (UNTU) is in the process of launching a Nedlac Section 77 process through its affiliated federation, the Federation of Trade Unions of South Africa (Fedusa), which will allow protest action to force the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) and Transport Minister Dr Blade Nzimande to find solutions for the ongoing attacks against UNTU members employed by PRASA’s Metrorail business. The announcement follows after another week of violent attacks on train crews, metro guards and protection services nationwide. “We are at the end of the road. This will be the second Section 77 application launched by UNTU through Fedusa at Nedlac. In the previous application, at a meeting held by the Nedlac Standing Committee with the parties to try and bring them together to find solutions, PRASA once again made empty promises and never responded to Nedlac,” UNTU general secretary Steve Harris said in a statement on Monday. The Section 77 process refers to Section 77 of the Labour Relations Act, which speaks to protest action to promote or defend the socioeconomic interests of workers. The intention of this section is primarily to bring disputing parties together to engage on a matter in order to find resolutions and, at the same time, to try and prevent any protest action which is burdensome to both workers and employers and negatively affects the economy. The latest spree of incidents include a Metrorail train driver being shot at when passing the end of the platform at Umbogintwini Station, as well as a security officer being assaulted by a commuter on the same route in KwaZulu-Natal. Some of the most recent attacks include a train being petrol bombed and looted at Orient Hills, near Krugersdorp, and a PRASA security vehicle being shot at. Both incidents took place on January 27. Once the Section 77 application has been submitted to Nedlac, UNTU and Fedusa will announce details of its planned protest action.
