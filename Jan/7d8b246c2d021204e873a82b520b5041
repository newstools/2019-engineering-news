Ethiopia charged the former head of military-run industrial conglomerate METEC with corruption on Thursday, nearly two months after his arrest. Kinfe Dagnew was charged with four counts of corruption related to the procurement of tractors, said a judge in the Lideta High Court in Addis Ababa. His co-defendants faced three further charges. Kinfe was arrested after a months-long investigation into METEC, which uncovered suspicious procurement practices involving more than $2 billion.
