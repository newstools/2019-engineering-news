JSE-listed Emira Property Fund is set to complete the total refurbishment of its 9 800 m2 warehouse facility, located in the industrial hub of Denver, Johannesburg, by March. Emira is investing R8.2-million in the revamp project. “By refurbishing our Denver warehouse, Emira is furthering our strategy to improve the quality of our assets. “This property is part of our core portfolio because it has great fundamentals in place, an excellent location in an established industrial area, easy highway access, security and ample electrical power. Now, with this upgrade, we are refreshing the building to support the latest warehousing and business operations,” COO Ulana van Biljon commented in a statement published on Tuesday. The new building will comprise about 1 000 m2 of contemporary offices with a new entrance. A new courtyard will bridge the offices and the 8 800 m2 warehouse. Both the offices and the warehouse will be fitted with energy-efficient lighting to lower occupancy costs at the facility. The entire building will boast a new façade, including linear feature lighting. The upgraded warehouse property will feature a new gatehouse, positioned at a reconfigured entrance point with electric gates, supporting both security and ease of access. New fencing will surround its entire perimeter. Further, new parking canopies are being installed to cover 86 of the 120-plus parking bays. The property will also benefit from a water-wise landscaping makeover. The facility is expected to offer affordable rental and generous tenant allowances.
