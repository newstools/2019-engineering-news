The average dam levels in the Western Cape and the dams supplying the City of Cape are considerably higher than the prior two years, data released by the provincial Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning Department shows. The average dam level in the Western Cape on Monday was 49.6%, compared with the recorded 25.2% and 39.4% respectively at the same time in 2018 and 2017. The water levels of the dams supplying the City of Cape Town are at an average of 61.3%, compared with 26.9% in 2018 and 39.9% in 2017, said Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning Minister Anton Bredell. Updating the public on the water levels, he noted that the Theewaterskloof dam was currently at 47.4%, up from 13.9%, while the Voëlvlei dam’s level increased to 78.4%, from 18.7% last year. The Berg River dam’s levels grew from 53.9% in the comparative period last year to the current 85.1%, while the Clanwilliam dam’s level increased from 18.4% in 2018 to 57.6% by January 21. “The drought in the Karoo remains very serious, but multiple projects remain on the go to ensure communities continue to have access to drinking water,” said Bredell. “The province has several ongoing projects across the region and has stepped in at the Kannaland municipality in the past ten days to assist in the rehabilitation of the Calitzdorp water treatment plant.” He explained that the plant had not been adequately maintained and the water quality was poor. Work in Laingsburg and Beaufort West is also continuing. “The Department of Local Government through the provincial disaster management centre continues to coordinate all relief efforts across the province. “We must again repeat that there is a serious water challenge in the Karoo but, to date, no community has run out of water and many areas are still getting water from groundwater sources. The province has multiple contingencies in place that have not yet failed,” he concluded.
