Cape Town dam levels sit at 62% average capacity, a huge improvement from the 27% capacity at this time last year when Cape Town was in the grips of a crippling drought. The City of Cape Town said on Tuesday “dam levels have made an improvement by averaging 62% now, compared to averaging 27% at this time last year”. “The City encourages water users to continue to be water-wise and to build on the good conservation practices they adopted to beat the drought,” the City said. Cape Town’s water restrictions have been lowered from level 5 to level 3 since December 3, which translates into an increase in the daily usage of water from 70 litres per person to 105 litres per person. The city's total water usage target has also increased from 500-million litres per day to 650 litres per day and the tariffs have been lowered to that of level 3. If, for example, residents use less than 6 000 litres per month they can expect to pay 35,5% less.
