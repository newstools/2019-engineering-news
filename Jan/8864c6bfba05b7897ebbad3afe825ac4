A second member of President Cyril Ramaphosa's task team on Eskom has stepped down, the Presidency spokesperson Khusela Diko confirmed to Fin24. Diko told Fin24 on Thursday via Whatsapp thatÂ Sy Gourrah of Actom had asked to leave the task team in December. "She requested to be recused as the company she works for has dealings with Eskom and to avoid a potential conflict of interest, she asked the President to release her from the panel. The President acceded to her request," Diko said. Last year former Eskom CEO Brian Dames also stepped down over a "perceived conflict of interest relating to the scope of work and terms of reference of the Eskom Sustainability Task Team".
