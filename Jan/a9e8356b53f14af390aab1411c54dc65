Transport Minister Dr Blade Nzimande expects the process to appoint a permanent group CEO for the Passenger Railway Agency of South Africa (PRASA) to be completed by April. He stated this in a reply to a Parliamentary question by Democratic Alliance MP Chris Hunsinger, dated January 9. The PRASA board appointed an interim group CEO on June 1, 2018, for 12 months while the process of appointing a permanent replacement is under way. The Minister said the process to identify a suitable candidate, undertaken through the recruitment policy of PRASA, is open and transparent, while the board is overseeing the selection process.
