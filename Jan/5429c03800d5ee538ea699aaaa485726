Mohammed Akoojee will take over as CEO of integrated outsourced logistics provider Imperial Logistics with effect from February 1. This follows the earlier-than-expected conclusion of the handover process. Akoojee’s predecessor Marius Swanepoel announced his retirement in August 2018, with the group initially having planned for the handover process to be completed by June this year. Swanepoel will continue to serve as an executive director on the company’s board until June 30, and will remain employed by Imperial Logistics until December 31. Until then, Swanepoel will be responsible for special projects and be available for strategic counsel.
