From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: To promote renewable energy as a cost-effective technology amid climate change and global warming, the University of South Africa, Exxaro Resources and the South African National Energy Development Institution launched in November its first institutional anaerobic digester. Simone Liedtke reports. Simone Liedtke: Dubbing it a “man-made stomach”, Working for Energy general manager David Mahuma explains that these anaerobic digesters will be used as a source of fuel and that it will also help the environment by minimizing organic waste. Working for Energy GM David Mahuma: Simone Liedtke: Despite it being an “age old technology” being used, he further tells us a bit about the rationale surrounding how the idea, and project, came to life. Working for Energy GM David Mahuma: Simone Liedtke: Nineteen more installations are in the pipeline to be installed at a variety of locations, with a particular focus on institutions including, but not limited to, old age homes, schools and clinics. This focus on institutions, Mahuma explains, is because of a higher ratio of people who can benefit from one such system at an institution. Working for Energy GM David Mahuma: Simone Liedtke: The anaerobic digesters are also able to help to stabilise food security and facilitate sustainable waste management. Working for Energy GM David Mahuma: Sashnee Moodley: That’s Creamer Media’s Real Economy Report. Join us again next week for more news and insight into South Africa’s real economy.
