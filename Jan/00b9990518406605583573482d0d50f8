Embattled State-owned flag-carrier South African Airways (SAA) announced on Tuesday that Advocate Vusi Pikoli had been appointed as the airline’s Chief Risk and Compliance Officer. He will take up the post on February 1. Pikoli is currently an adviser to the Minister of State Security. He was, from 2005 to 2007, South Africa’s National Director of Public Prosecutions. He has some experience of aviation, having been involved in the reinsurance of aircraft fleets when he was employed by an insurance company. “The appointment of Advocate Pikoli is as important as it is significant in demonstrating our resolve to bringing capacity to strengthen the executive team to execute on our turnaround strategy with much urgency,” affirmed SAA spokesperson Tlali Tlali. “He brings a wealth of experience and is known to be a disciplined and strong administrator.” The SAA executive is determined to root out corruption. “We are resolute about our commitment to restore and maintain good governance at required levels at SAA as this is one of the important enablers for the effective implementation of our turnaround plan,” he added. Pikoli will report to airline Group CEO Vuyani Jarana and will be responsible for risk management and aviation and general legislative compliance. In addition, he has the strategic and operational responsibility for SAA’s integrated risk management strategy.
