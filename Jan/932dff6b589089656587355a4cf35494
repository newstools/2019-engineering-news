Integrated satellite communications company Intelsat has become a full member of London-based association GMSA in an effort to build stronger working relationships and develop business models that accelerate the expansion of more powerful mobile networks. The association represents more than 750 operators worldwide with over 350 handset and device makers, software companies, equipment providers and Internet companies, as well as firms in adjacent industry sectors. Incorporating the strengths of different technologies under one seamless network will accelerate the development of the fifth-generation (5G) network architecture, further strengthen the integration of satellite and terrestrial technologies and create hybrid networks. “As 5G comes to market, we must capitalise on the strengths of multiple delivery technologies to satiate the connectivity demands of businesses and communities around the world,” said Intelsat VP and networks GM Jean-Philippe Gillet. He explained that satellites complemented terrestrial mobile networks in ubiquitously, seamlessly and cost-effectively delivering connectivity across urban and rural regions. “We will collaborate even more closely with companies across the mobile ecosystem and build innovative partnerships that incorporate the complementary strengths of satellite and terrestrial technologies and create the hybrid networks that advance the cost-effective deployment of mobile connectivity around the world.”
