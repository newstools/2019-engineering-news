The Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works has started a project to improve and reseal 16.5 km of trunk road between Holgaten and Oudtshoorn, and reseal another 6.7 km section of trunk road between Holgaten and Uniondale. The first section is a major north-south link between Oudtshoorn and George, while serving the N12/R62 route to the Southern Cape. The second section is a major west-east link between Holgaten and Uniondale, serving the N9/R62 route to the Southern Cape. The R55-million project is expected to be complete by the end of the year. The works on the project includes patch repairs to the existing pavement, shoulder reinstatement, general maintenance of major structures and resurfacing. Auxiliary lanes will also be built at certain locations along the first mentioned sector of trunk road. The construction of six auxiliary lanes, on the first section, is expected to take place from mid-January to end-October, using 24-hour stop/go controls. Motorists can also expect such controls to be in place from February to May on the second section.
