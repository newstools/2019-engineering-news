Construction group Aveng’s Australian subsidiary McConnell Dowell, has secured contracts to the value of R8.5-billion in the first half of the 2019 financial year. This supports McConnell’s baseline revenue for financial year 2020 and beyond. McConnell provides engineering and construction solutions to the infrastructure, building and resource sectors across Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific and Southeast Asia. Contracts awarded during the year so far include the Tuas water reclamation project, in Singapore; the Wingfold Tower luxury apartment complex, in Australia; and the Pukekohe wastewater treatment plant and the Stanley street stormwater upgrades, both in New Zealand. Additionally, McConnell has been selected to head up the Wynyard Edge Alliance, in Auckland, New Zealand. Working alongside Downer, BECA, Tonkin and Taylor, Auckland council and MBIE, the alliance will design and build the infrastructure to support the 36th America’s Cup in New Zealand, to be held in 2021. McConnell said these contract awards underpin the company’s strategic plan of steady growth, reliable performance and being a valued business partner through a disciplined project pursuit pipeline. The awards in the first half of financial year 2019 total over R8.5-billion, taking McConnell’s order book to R11.4-billion as at December 31, 2018, which is up 50% from the order book of R7.6-billion as at June 30, 2018.
