Newly appointed COO and director Andrew Openshaw will assume his new roles at Huge Group from March 1. Huge announced Openshaw’s appointment in December; however, the start date remained subject to his restraint of trade commitments to Reunert being waived or fulfilled. Openshaw will assume responsibility for extracting value from Huge’s current real estate of customers, which now exceeds 50 000, and thereafter, growing it, both organically and by acquisition.
