The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) has cancelled the public hearings into Eskom’s third multiyear price determination (MYPD3) regulatory clearing account (RCA) Year 5 (2017/18) application and its MYPD4 revenue application, that were scheduled to take place in Kimberley, in the Northern Cape, and Polokwane, in Limpopo, on January 21 and 31 respectively. The cancellation is as a result of low public interest. Nersa is conducting public hearings on Eskom’s MYPD3 RCA Year 5 (2017/18) application and its revenue application for the 2019/20, 2020/21 and 2021/22 financial years. The public hearings started in the Western Cape on January 14 and will conclude in Gauteng on February 4. Public hearings in other provinces will continue as scheduled.
