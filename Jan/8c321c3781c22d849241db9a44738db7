Europe-based global major aerospace and defence group Airbus on Tuesday launched a global quantum computing development competition. The Airbus Quantum Computing Challenge (AQCC) is intended to stimulate proposals and solutions regarding “complex optimisation and modelisation” (in Airbus’ words) across the complete lifecycle of an aircraft, using the capabilities made available by the latest developments in computing. The group already employs high performance computing. “With traditional computers approaching their limits, the quantum computer promises to deliver a new level of computational power,” affirms the company. “Airbus is already extending current capacity by integrating and leveraging quantum technologies in fields such as route optimisation and satellite imagery.” The aim of the AQCC is to move scientific developments from the laboratory to the factory, through using the recently-developed computing technologies to real-world industrial programmes. The challenge will run for the whole of this year. It is open to both individuals and teams, academics and start-up enterprises, postgraduate students, researchers, PhDs and professionals in the area of quantum computing. They will compete for access to hardware and for the chance to develop their concepts for industrialisation, in collaboration with industry experts from Airbus. “Through the challenge Airbus is looking to further explore solutions that quantum technologies can bring through the sharing of in-house and external knowledge, data and expertise. Five distinct challenges have been identified in the flight physics domain that have an impact on all aspects of Airbus’ business, from design and operations, to airline revenue streams. With varying degrees of complexity, the statements range from the simple optimisation of aircraft climb to the more complex optimisation of wing-box design.”
