The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the South African Revenue Service (Sars) and the National Treasury on Friday signed a memorandum of cooperation (MoC), in which all parties agreed to continue working together in the area of taxation. The MoC is in place until December 2023. Building on a long history of collaboration, the MoC provides for the continuation of such cooperation towards the achievement of the common objective of promoting fair and efficient tax systems and administration, strengthening and modernising international taxation areas through the sharing of experiences between Sars, the National Treasury and OECD member countries. The MoC was signed by OECD global relations and development division head at the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration Ben Dickinson, Sars acting commissioner Mark Kingon and National Treasy acting director-general Stadi Mngomezulu. During the signing ceremony, Dickinson noted that collaboration through blended learning and e-learning would be expanded during 2019. National Treasury director-general Dondo Mogajane, meanwhile, said that “it is through cooperative ventures such as this one . . . that we can enhance our efforts to collect taxes and strengthen our democracy”. Further, Kingon remained “pleased for the continuation of the structured relationship that the MoC with the OECD will provide Sars with”, particularly in focusing on a whole-of-government approach to tax administration, as well as further honing the skills of officials in international taxation, he added.
