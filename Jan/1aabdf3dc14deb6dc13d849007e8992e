South Africa's Deputy Finance Minister and chairperson of the State-owned Public Investment Corporation (PIC), Mondli Gungubele, said on Wednesday he had done nothing wrong after a whistleblower made new corruption allegations at the pension fund. "I am confident I have done nothing wrong," he said in a statement. The PIC, which has nearly R2-trillion of civil servants' pensions under its custody, said earlier on Wednesday it was conducting an investigation into allegations made against its acting CEO and two of its board members.
