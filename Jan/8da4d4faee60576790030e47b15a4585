The Department of Labour (DoL) has set up a formal inquiry into the collapse of a structure that was under construction last year on the premises of Imperial Logistics, in Durban. The collapse led to the death of four employees and the injury of four others. On March 28, 2018, a precast roofing company was busy installing concrete precast roof slabs, when the structure collapsed. The collapse caused structural damages to an adjacent building and a heavy-duty vehicle that was stationary on the public road along the perimeter fence of the premises. Subsequently, DoL inspectors had issued a prohibition notice to Imperial Logistics, stopping any further work from being undertaken until the circumstances and root cause surrounding the collapse were investigated. The first session of the inquiry will be held from January 21 to February 1 at the KwaZulu-Natal Master Builders Associationâ€™s offices, in Westville. The inquiry, initiated by DoL chief inspector Tibor Szana, will investigate levels of adherence to occupational health and safety (OHS) standards and negligence that could have caused injuries and the death of employees. DoL OHS specialist Sandile Kubeka has been appointed the presiding inspector of the inquiry. Eighteen witnesses have been identified to testify before the commission, after which additional witnesses may be called to testify.
