South African insurer Santam will effect a secondary listing of its shares on the A2X, effective February 1. It will retain its listings on the JSE and the Namibian Stock Exchange. “We are continually looking for new ways to add benefit to our clients and shareholders. We see this additional listing as an opportunity to attract potential new investors. More importantly, we are pleased to be complementing our existing listings on the JSE and Namibian Stock Exchange with a listing on A2X,” Santam CEO Lizé Lambrechts said in a statement published on Friday.
 
A2X, which is a licensed stock exchange that provides an additional listing opportunity for companies, has 15 companies listed on its platform.
