The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) on Wednesday raised a red flag over the continued decline of the water levels of the Vaal dam. The Vaal dam, one of the major dams within the Integrated Vaal River System (IVRS), recorded water levels of 74.1% this week, compared with 79.4% in the comparative period last year. This is despite a slight improvement last week when the water levels increased from 74% to 75.2% week-on-week. “This could have a serious impact on water supply to businesses and households if water demand and dry weather conditions continue to rise,” the department said in a statement. “The dam levels spelled a bleak picture this week . . . as other dams in the system shrunk to lower levels while others remained stagnant.” The levels of the Grootdraai dam edged lower from 76% last week to 75.4% this week, and down from the recorded levels of 100.4% during the comparative period last year. Both the Mohale and Katse dams remain well below the 50% mark, at 18.1% and 39.8%, respectively. The Sterkfontein and Bloemhof dams remain unchanged week-on-week at 94% and 61.5%, respectively.
