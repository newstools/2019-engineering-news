JSE-listed African Oxygen (Afrox) chairperson Bernd Eulitz has resigned, with effect from April 1. John Panikar will assume the role of chairperson of the board and member of the Nominations, Governance and Management of Resources Committee, following Eulitz’s resignation. As a result of his position as Linde regional president for the UK, Ireland and South Africa, Panikar will not be considered an independent chairperson. Accordingly, Dr Khotso Mokhele will remain the lead independent director. Eulitz had served two terms as chairperson of the board. He is also a member of Linde Group’s board of directors and head of its operating segment in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and will, following the Linde–Praxair merger, be assuming a new role as executive VP for Linde’s Americas operations.
