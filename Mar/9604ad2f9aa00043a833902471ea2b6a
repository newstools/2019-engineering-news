Wineries Nederburg and KWV have ranked in the top 50 list of the “World’s Most Admired Wine Brands” in UK-based publication Drinks International. Nederburg and KWV are the only two South African wine brands that made the list, which selects out of more than 200 of the most renowned names in the wine industry, this year. Nederburg ranked forty-seventh in this year’s survey, while South Africa’s KWV ranked forty-fifth. Wine market research and consultancy firm Wine Intelligence lent its expertise for this year’s survey. According to Drinks International, to make it onto the list, winemakers have to show consistent or improving quality, a reflection of region or country of origin, a responsiveness to the needs and tastes of target audiences, excellent marketing and packaging and a strong appeal to a wide demographic. “Such high-level affirmation for Nederburg is a major boost for us. Over the past few years, we’ve been hard at work in building Nederburg’s global brand presence and appeal in key markets by introducing new innovative wines and securing new listings, an exciting global communications campaign for which we have won a variety of awards, and our alignment with pro-cycling via our sponsorship of Team Dimension Data for Qhubeka, the first African cycling team to race in the iconic Tour de France. “We are not resting on our laurels, though. We are geared to continue taking Nederburg to the next level. Over the coming months and years, we will be rolling out some new brand aspects to entice wine consumers worldwide to keep on discovering Nederburg and its many facets and stories,” says Nederburg global marketing manager Jackie Olivier. "More than anything, this reflects our resolute commitment to our brands and consumers, ensuring our wines deliver consistent great experiences, never breaking the trust we have built over more than 100 years,” said KWV wine marketing executive Liandra Kotzé.
