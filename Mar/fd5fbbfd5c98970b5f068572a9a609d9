The chief executive and chairman of the African Energy Chamber (EnergyChamber.org), NJ Ayuk, has called for more industry collaboration on key issues pertaining to Nigeria’s oil and gas industry. Ayuk made the call for strengthened cooperation as he led an industry delegation to Nigeria this week to meet various oil industry players, a press release by the Energy Chamber said. According to the chamber CEO this cooperation should involve the signing of the Petroleum Industry Bill, the promotion of a better enabling environment for start-ups and SMEs, and monetising gas for domestic use. He also recommended investing massively in energy infrastructure and building a robust petrochemical industry whilst ensuring that energy security is placed as a high priority agenda by both the Nigerian government and the country’s oil industry. This notably involves the signing of the Petroleum Industry Bill. Nigeria is Africa’s biggest oil producer with a massive investment potential in oil but also gas. In this regard, the Chamber’s delegation highlighted the importance for both the government and key stakeholders in the oil industry to immediately collaborate to improve governance and create an enabling environment for investment. “The Chamber continues to be bullish about the potential of Nigeria and the investment opportunities for energy industry players here,” said Ayuk. “Many young Nigerians look at the energy industry for training, empowerment, innovation, and not just any job but good jobs. The oil industry is going to continue being the largest investor in the country and recognises its responsibility to work with all Nigerians to ensure that the resources benefit every Nigerian and the dignity of work becomes real. “Passing pro-growth legislation that motivates growth and provides confidence to all investors is important,” added Ayuk.
