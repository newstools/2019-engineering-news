Industry association South African Real Estate Investment Trust (SA Reit) Property Sector Charter Council (PSCC) representative Dr Sedise Moseneke has been elected chairperson of the council. The council is responsible for implementing transformation in the property sector. Moseneke is also Vukile Property Fund executive director, Encha Property Services nonexecutive chairperson and a former South African Property Owners Association president. Moseneke succeeds outgoing PSCC chairperson Saul Gumede. Moseneke said in a statement on Tuesday that there is a misconception about transformation in the property sector that he hopes to help correct. “Despite perceptions to the contrary, much is being achieved by business and government transformation initiatives in the industry. Building on this with industry-based programmes will assist [in entrenching] transformation and make it systemic in the property sector.”  To achieve this, and other council objectives, he saw scope for greater collaboration between the SA Reit sector, other private property stakeholders and the government at all levels. “This collaboration should always be defined by good governance and ethics. We must be transparent and corruption-free in all interactions between the sector, government and all its departments,” stressed Moseneke.  The PSCC will continue to issue its widely referenced research that shows the impact the sector has on the economy.
