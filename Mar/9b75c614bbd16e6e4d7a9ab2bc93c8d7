The UK-South Africa Tech Hub has, in partnership with the Future Females movement, launched the Future Females Business School Programme at Work in Progress, at the Woodstock Exchange, in Cape Town. This marks the third local tech empowerment initiative launched by Tech Hub, this one being part of a vision and mission to support female entrepreneurs and gender inclusion in tech spaces in South Africa. The UK-SA Tech Hub is the first in a global network of international tech partnerships developed by the UKâ€™s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, to help build digital ecosystems that will facilitate sustainable economic growth. Through the programme, 50 successful candidates will develop their skills over three months, across 12 content modules. It is aimed at providing the entrepreneurial skills needed to register and launch their businesses. The programme uses various skills development seminars, ranging from writing an effective business plan, to building their online presence. Additionally, the programme is assisted by guest experts, including serial entrepreneurs, executives and coaches, who cover critical personal development topics, such as overcoming fear of failure and uncovering true passion. The selected businesses will use technology to generate sustainable incomes for their female founders, while delivering a positive impact on their communities.
