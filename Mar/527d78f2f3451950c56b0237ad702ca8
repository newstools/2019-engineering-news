Vivo Energy has completed a transaction with Engen Holdings, that will result in Vivo adding 230 Engen-branded service stations to its portfolio. Vivo now owns 2 000 services stations across 23 African markets, including eight markets – – Gabon, Malawi, Mozambique, Reunion, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe – it has entered for the first time as a result of the Engen transaction. Following the transaction, Engen retains its interest in Engen Petroleum – its South Africa business and refinery – and its businesses in Mauritius, Botswana, Ghana, Namibia, Swaziland and Lesotho, which are not part of the transaction. Engen’s business in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) remains under evaluation by Vivo Energy, pending any agreement between Engen and the DRC government regarding the transfer of the subsidiary holding Engen’s DRC interests.
