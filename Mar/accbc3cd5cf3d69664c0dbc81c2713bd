The Construction Education and Training Authority (Ceta) will present its five-year strategy for progressing small, medium-sized and microenterprises (SMMEs) in the built environment sector at the Ceta SMME Summit later this month. The summit will highlight the current SMME landscape in the construction industry and will serve as a platform to discuss and understand the existing concerns and barriers to growth and sustainability for small businesses in the sector. Topics that will be covered include technical competence, entrepreneurial acumen, business regulations, seed capital, financial management, driving market access opportunities and leveraging professional bodies to support growth. Around 650 representatives from established and emerging companies have confirmed their attendance.
