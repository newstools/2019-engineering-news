Domestic new-vehicle sales faced a second consecutive month of decline this year, dropping by 6.5% in February, to 43 251 units, compared with the same month last year. New-vehicle sales numbers released on Friday showed that February new-passenger car sales fell by 13.3%, to 27 000 units. Sales of new bakkies, minibuses and vans, at 14 123 units, delivered good news, however, increasing by 7.1%. Truck sales also showed a positive trend. Sales of medium trucks, at 662 units, grew by 14.3%. Sales of new heavy trucks and buses increased by 8%, to 1 466 units. New-vehicle exports surged ahead in February, growing by 22.5%, to 33 731 units. The National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa) said in a statement that vehicle exports should expand further in 2019. The association said export sales could reach 400 000 units this year compared with the 351 139 vehicles exported in 2018. The local new-vehicle market would not necessarily achieve the same growth curve. “Prospects for domestic new vehicle sales, particularly the new car market, will continue to be affected by the subdued current macro-economic environment and general pressure on household disposable income,” noted Naamsa. “It is expected that the low-growth environment will continue until after the general election. “Post-election policy reforms and government's commitment to revitalise the South African economy . . . should translate into improved domestic sales numbers during the second half of 2019.” Top-selling cars, bakkies and vans in February:
