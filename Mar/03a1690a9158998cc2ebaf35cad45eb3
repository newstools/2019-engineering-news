Parliament's portfolio committee on home affairs has recommended an urgent investigation into the procurement process followed for the Automated Biometric Identification Systems expected to replace the obsolete Home Affairs National Identity Register. "The decision to recommend an investigation was to ensure that the awarding of the contract is above board and adheres to governance standards set out by the National Treasury," it said. "The investigation must happen before the 5th Parliament rises to enable the committee to consider it." The committee said it had also raised concerns around the capacity within the State Information Technology Agency in delivering quality information and technology services to the state that enabled quick and responsive services.
