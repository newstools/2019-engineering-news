The State-owned Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) has put company secretary Lindikaya Zide, chief information officer Chris Mbatha, corporate real estate solutions CEO Tara Ngubane and suspended enterprise risk GM Tumi Mohube, on special leave, in light of continued allegations of unethical expenditure. PRASA group CEO Dr Nkosinathi Sishi on Friday said the suspension or putting on special leave of the four executives was to ensure a fair process of investigation and for these employees to prepare their answers to the allegations, before appearing before an independent panel that will hear the matter. “The work that is being undertaken by the board in this regard is to ensure that allegations of conduct that fails to meet the standard that will improve the travel experience of our commuters and passengers is dealt with decisively. “The extent of improper, fruitless and wasteful expenditure that is reported by various independent professionals shows a disturbing culture of impunity which has to be stemmed at once,” said PRASA chairperson Khanyisile Kweyama.
