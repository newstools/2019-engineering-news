JSE-listed chemicals company Omnia Holdings has appointed Seelan Gobalsamy group FD, effective March 1. Gobalsamy, who has been an independent nonexecutive director since September 2018, will also be appointed executive director. “As a function of his extensive financial services experience and his tenure as a nonexecutive director of Omnia, Gobalsamy enjoys a unique understanding of Omnia’s drive to move beyond commodities and into the innovative solutions space, as well as its global expansion strategy. “The function of the group FD will be expanded to one of partnering closely with the CEO to drive the execution of the strategy to realise the transition of Omnia from a local to a global business. His significant prior experience will benefit the group as it repositions and restructures future growth,” Omnia said in a statement on Friday.
