Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams has given effect to a National Assembly resolution and removed Rubben Mohlaloga as a councillor and chairperson of the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa). On March 19, the National Assembly resolved that Mohlaloga should be removed as Icasa chairperson with immediate effect, following his conviction on fraud and money laundering charges in January 2018. The Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in February sentenced him to 20 years in prison. The Icasa council will elect an acting chairperson, while a process to appoint a successor is under way.
