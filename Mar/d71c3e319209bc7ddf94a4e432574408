Eskom has announced there is a low risk of rotational load-shedding on Monday. In a power alert, the utility encouraged residents and businesses to keep using electricity sparingly. It did not provide further information. The last round of load-shedding occurred in February. The debt-laden power utility has not yet instituted rotational power cuts in March, although it did last week warn of a 'high risk" of stage 1 load-shedding.
