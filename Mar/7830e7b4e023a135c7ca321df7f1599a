President Cyril Ramaphosa has authorised the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to investigate alleged wrongdoing within the Johannesburg metropolitan municipality (City of Joburg) or its service providers in relation to the city’s procurement of vehicles from Fire Raiders in a 2014 tender that was valued at R86.4-million. Whistleblowers have alleged that while the costs associated with the purchase of the so-called “red fleet” were paid to the service provider, delivery was not effected. The SIU is mandated to investigate any alleged serious maladministration in connection with the affairs of the municipality; improper or unlawful conduct by employees or officials of the municipality; unlawful appropriation or expenditure of public money or property; and unlawful, irregular or unapproved acquisitive acts, transactions measures or practices that have a bearing on State property. The investigation will cover the period from January 1, 2009, to now. The investigation will extend into allegations of wrongdoing regarding repairs and maintenance at fire stations in Johannesburg, the procurement of closed-circuit television equipment and related services and the procurement of office accommodation and furniture for the city’s Integrated Operations Centre.
