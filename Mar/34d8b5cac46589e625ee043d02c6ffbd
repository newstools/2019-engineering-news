South32â€™s Mozal Aluminium smelter, which is located in the Mozambique capital Maputo, has pledged a $250 000 donation to support recovery efforts following the devastating impact of Cyclone Idai in the country. Commenting in a statement on Friday, Mozal VP Samuel Samo Gudo said the company had committed to making a difference to the communities impacted by the event, especially those in the city of Beira, which has become partially isolated from other parts of the country. The donation will be made to a humanitarian institution in Mozambique to help resolve food and water shortages and help restore infrastructure in the affected areas. Further to the $250 000 contribution, the company is coordinating monetary and nonperishable food donations from its employees. South32 will also match any financial contributions from employees around the world committed through its employee matched giving programme.
