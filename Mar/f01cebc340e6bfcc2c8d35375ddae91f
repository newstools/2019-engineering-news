Eskom says load-shedding could be implemented at short notice on Friday, as the power system remains tight and vulnerable. "[....] while Eskom is making every effort to limit load-shedding, it could be implemented at short notice should there be a shift in plant performance. This could include a significant loss in generating plant due to unplanned technical breakdowns," it said. It added that load-shedding would only be implemented if "absolutely necessary". Tariffs On Thursday the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) announced that it had approved electricity hikes of 9.41%, 8.1% and 5.2% for the next three financial years, far below Eskomâ€™s application for double-digit tariff increases.
