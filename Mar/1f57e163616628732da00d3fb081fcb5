Cash-strapped low-cost African airline Fastjet Plc said on Friday it had managed to extend the terms of a loan to March 31. Fastjet in June had entered agreements with Annunaki Investments and SSCG Africa Holdings, following which the airline lent $5-million from its Zimbabwe unit to Annunaki in return for a $2-million loan to Fastjet from SSCG. The low-cost airline said on Friday that the loan amount from Fastjet Zimbabwe to Annunaki had increased from $5-million to $7-million, after certain currency devaluations.
