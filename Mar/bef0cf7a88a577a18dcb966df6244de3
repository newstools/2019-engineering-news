Minister of Trade and Industry Dr Rob Davies has hailed Hisense’s investment of R72-million into its refrigeration and television production lines at its factory in Atlantis, in Cape Town, as an “important achievement” and “another example of the fruits of South Africa’s successful partnership with the Republic of China”. He also said the Hisense investment signified that South Africa remains an attractive investment destination across all sectors, including advanced manufacturing. Davies was speaking at the official launch of the expansion, which was also attended by Hisense Middle East–Africa president Jeyy Liu. Hisense, a global company providing flat panel televisions, household appliances and mobile communication devices, has expanded its plant in Atlantis, Western Cape. “Everyone who is involved with this kind of a project needs to be extremely proud of what has been achieved here, because this is an important investment which has injected R72-million into the economy and created 150 quality manufacturing job opportunities. Moreover, this investment brings Hisense’s total investment in this Atlantis plant to R440-million, which is a significant investment,” said Davies. He also said that the Hisense plant was an example of the commitment of government in general, and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in particular, to supporting manufacturing in South Africa as a whole, but specifically in Atlantis, and in the fast-moving consumer goods industry. “As a department we are very happy that the first investment was supported by the DTI through is Manufacturing and Competitive Enhance Programme, as well as through the tariff rate dispensation that has supported the investment in the fridges,” said Davies.
