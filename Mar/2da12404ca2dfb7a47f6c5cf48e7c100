Adverse movements in JSE-listed African Oxygen’s (Afrox’s) operating environment resulted in the company’s headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the year ended December 31, 2018, decreasing by 23% year-on-year to 154.9c. Basic earnings per share (EPS) decreased by 29% to 144.8c, while diluted EPS decreased by 28.6% to 144c. Adjusted for nonrecurring items, normalised HEPS decreased by 16.9% to 167c and EPS by 11.8% to 169.8c. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) declined by 9% from R1.1-billion to R1-billion. Operating profit, or Ebit, at R596-million, was 30.3% lower year-on-year. Adjusted for nonrecurring items, the company’s Ebit declined by 17.8%. Overall, this reduction in Ebit was as a result of higher operational costs, additional plant breakdown costs of R56-million, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stock devaluation, a market price impact of R32-million and an increase in depreciation of R45-million. Despite these challenges, however, the underlying growth in strategic markets, solid price cost inflation recovery and continued productivity gains from various efficiency projects, helped to offset the cost increases during the period. Afrox, therefore, managed to increase its revenue by 6.2% to just over R6-billion, from a  combination of higher volumes in certain sectors of the business and successful recovery of cost inflation as a result of effective price management. Higher market prices in the LPG segment contributed to that growth and revenue adjusted for changes in LPG market price increased by 2.3%. In December 2018, Afrox announced another restructuring to address its fixed cost base, functional market strategy and the change in operating segments. R52-million has been provided in 2018 for the 2019 restructuring. Meanwhile, as part of its Atmospheric Gases business, Afrox finalised the installation for the additional healthcare business and invested a further R150-million during 2018. Afrox now delivers medical gases and regulators to the public healthcare sector in all nine provinces. There was continued volume erosion in the Hard Goods segment and lower volumes in the company’s Industrial Packaged Gas business because of reduced levels of South African business activity. Operating cash flow of R897-million decreased by R100-million, or 10%, compared with the prior year. The company’s capital expenditure had increased by R150-million as a result of the State Healthcare tender and air separation unit plant upgrades of R61-million; additional cash used to acquire shares in respect of the share incentive scheme of R57-million; and the acquisition of the remaining 30% of the equity in Afrox Zambia of R41-million. All of this, combined, resulted in a net cash position of  just over R1.1-billion.
