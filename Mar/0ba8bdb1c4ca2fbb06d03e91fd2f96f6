South African private-sector airline group Comair on Monday issued condolences and reassurances regarding the crash on Sunday of an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 single-aisle airliner. All 157 passengers and crew perished when the aircraft, only a few months old, plummeted to the ground near Bishoftu, some 60 km south-east of the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. This was the second crash of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 within five months, the previous one, involving an aircraft of Indonesian carrier Lion Air, cost 189 lives. The 737 MAX 8 only entered revenue service during 2017. Comair has ordered eight 737 MAX 8s, of which the first one was delivered late last month and the second will be delivered later this month. The airline pointed out that, as of last November, 330 737 MAX 8s were in operation around the world. The airline pointed out it could not speculate on the causes of the accident, which it described as a “heartbreaking tragedy”. It extended its sympathies to the loved ones of those who had died. “Comair will continue to monitor the various investigations by the relevant authorities and are [sic] in close contact with both Boeing and the SACAA [South African Civil Aviation Authority],” stated the airline. “Our trained and experienced flight crew and engineers remain vigilant.” Ethiopian Airlines has grounded its 737 MAX 8s, as has Cayman Airways. Civil aviation regulators in China and Indonesia have ordered all 737 MAX 8s operated by airlines in those countries to cease operations, pending the outcome of the accident enquiry. “If we receive information that requires us to reassess the situation, please be assured we will take appropriate action in the interests of the safety of our staff and customers,” assured Comair, which is continuing to operate its sole 737 MAX 8. “Safety remains our foremost priority and we will not compromise on the safety of our crew and our customers.”
