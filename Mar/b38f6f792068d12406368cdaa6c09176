The risk of load-shedding for Friday and the weekend is high, according to Eskom. The power producer made the announcement via an emailed statement late on Thursday night. "No load-shedding was implemented today (Thursday) due to some generating units returning to service, however the risk of load-shedding for [Friday] and the weekend remains high. "As the power system remains tight and volatile, the risk of rotational load-shedding remains high for [Friday] as well as for the weekend when we need to replenish emergency reserves (water and diesel) to limit the possibility of load-shedding in the following week. "Our maintenance teams continue to work around the clock to bring units back online."
