From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has, in partnership with Right ePharmacy, developed a pharmacy automation robot for medicine dispensing. Tasneem Bulbulia tells us more. Tasneem Bulbulia: The AVA43 robot was produced locally by the CSIR at its premises in Pretoria, and constitutes about 80% local materials. CSIR executive director Martin Sanne details the robot CSIR executive director Martin Sanne: Tasneem Bulbulia: Sanne also spoke to the safety of the robot, with measures in place to ensure it is not compromised CSIR executive director Martin Sanne: Tasneem Bulbulia: Sanne emphasised that the CSIR did not develop the robot to replace primary human jobs and responsibilities. CSIR executive director Martin Sanne: Tasneem Bulbulia: The robot was showcased by the CSIR during its Intelligent Manufacturing Systems ManuVation 4.0 workshop at the CSIR Campus, in Pretoria. The model that was showcased is a prototype, which will be installed in Alexandra, in Johannesburg, where it will serve as the first test model. Through the trial project, the CSIR will be able to assess elements such as whether the software and parts are working correctly and if they are up to standard, as well as if the robot can work 24 hours a day, identify any problems and determine how to fix them. Once this process has been completed and the model is deemed of appropriate standard, the CSIR will seek to engage entities to mass-produce the robots. Marketing will be undertaken by Right ePharmacy. Sashnee Moodley: That’s Creamer Media’s Real Economy Report. Join us again next week for more news and insight into South Africa’s real economy.
