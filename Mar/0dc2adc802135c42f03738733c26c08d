NYSE-listed engineering construction multinational Fluor Corporation, in a joint venture (JV) with TechnipFMC, has completed its engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) management services scope of work at Sasolâ€™s petrochemicals complex, in Westlake, Louisiana, in the US. The JV companies will continue assisting the South African petrochemicals giant with remaining activities, by working with Sasol in parallel on transition plans for each unit and system, as well as performance testing. The last of the units to be transitioned is a low-density polyethylene unit, which will be handed over by end-March. The JV started the incremental transition of assets to Sasol in November 2018. A 1.5-million-tonne-a-year ethane cracker is at the heart of the complex, which also includes six downstream chemical units and associated utilities, infrastructure and offsites. More than 6 000 staff were on site at peak to build the complex, which uses ethylene produced by the cracker to manufacture high-value chemicals, which are used in everyday consumer products. The JV integrated a team of 30 main construction contractors and worked in collaboration with Sasol to strengthen the local economy, with more than $4-billion committed to Louisiana businesses. The JV also invested in the local community by contributing around $185 000 to local schools and charitable organisations throughout the project.
