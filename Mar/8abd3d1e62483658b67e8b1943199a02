Forty-five community members from the informal settlements of Freedom Farm and Malawi Camp this week graduated in Competency Based Modular Training (CBMT) in House Building. The training, which started in September 2018 at a cost of R1.3-million, marks the second such initiative for Airports Company South Africa’s (ACSA’s) Cape Town International Airport (CTIA). The runway realignment plan at CTIA requires that the three informal settlements of Freedom Farm, Malawi Camp and Blikkiesdorp be relocated to secure its future expansion plans and, together with the city, a formal housing development is under way. As part of its commitment to these communities, CTIA is assisting community members by providing them access to key house building skills, which include bricklaying, carpentry, painting and plumbing. “Skills training such as this immediately makes these community members more employable and will hopefully help to improve their access to work,” commented CTIA GM Deon Cloete. “We are immensely proud of the 98% pass rate, something for which the students must be commended,” he added. “The specific focus of upskilling community members will afford them greater opportunities to become entrepreneurs or to look for job opportunities as skilled artisans, bricklayers, carpenters, painters and plumbers – all valuable and important skills needed for our growing economy and we are pleased that these newly skilled graduates are now ready and able to enter the job market,” said Cape Town executive mayor Dan Plato. As a continuation of this programme, ACSA plans to provide further scholarships to students who qualify to complete the 12-month comprehensive Community House Building Programme.
