Eskom has announced there is a high risk of rotational load-shedding on Monday, caused by a shortage of capacity due to the loss of generating units at our power stations. The power utility said the cuts would only be implemented if "absolutely necessary". "We continue to encourage residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during this period. Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand," it said in a statement.
