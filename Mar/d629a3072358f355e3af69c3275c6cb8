The department of transport and public works has been allocated more than R200-million of the Western Cape medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) to address and improve road and rail safety. The 2019 MTEF allocation of additional R255.50-million will address public transport requirements for rail enforcement teams. According to a statement, the Rail Enforcement Unit (REU) which was launched last year to assist the existing security services with the challenges the Metrorail faced, would resolve the ongoing rail crisis in Cape Town. The unit was formed following a memorandum of agreement between the City of Cape Town, the Western Cape government and the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa.
