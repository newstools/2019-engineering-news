Eskom has announced there is a high risk of rotational load shedding on Tuesday, saying the power system is constrained. The power utility called on customers to switch off all non-essential appliances to decrease pressure on the national grid. The utility on Monday also warned of a high risk of power cuts, but these were not implemented.
