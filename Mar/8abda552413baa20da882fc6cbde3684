The Port of Durban has recorded volume growth in the container, liquid bulk and dry bulk sectors in 2018, the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) reported on Wednesday. Container volumes increased by 9.5% year-on-year to 2.96-million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). Of this, container imports grew by 10% and exports by 17%. These were the highest volumes handled by the port in the last seven years. Dry bulk volumes grew by 5.8% year-on-year, driven mainly by dry bulk exports, while imports remained fairly stable. The biggest growth in imports was seen from rice and associated products, wheat, malt, fertiliser products, coal and coke, while maize, sugar and chrome ore exports also bolstered dry bulk volumes. Liquid bulk volumes grew by 3.1% year-on-year. This was mainly attributed to demand factors, as well as South Africa being a net importer of crude oil. TNPA also reported growth in the port’s automotive throughput, with imports up 4% year-on-year and exports more than 15% higher year-on-year. The Port of Durban has handled a total of just over 487 000 vehicle units in 2018 which is the highest since 2013 when a throughput of 503 000 units was recorded. Breakbulk volumes in 2018 were relatively on par with 2017 volumes. Throughput in this sector is noted as erratic, with some cargoes also migrating to other forms of handling such as the containerisation and dry bulk sectors. “The Port of Durban continues to work with terminal operators and other stakeholders to ensure improvements in terminal productivity levels for quicker ship turnaround times,” Port of Durban acting port manager Nokuzola Nkowane commented in a statement. “Operational efficiencies are the focus to drive volume performance.”
