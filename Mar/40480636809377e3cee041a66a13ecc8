To celebrate companies that have gone out of their way to invest in the environment, the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa (Seifsa) will present the Environment Stewardship Award to a company that has successfully implemented greening initiatives in its day-to-day business operations between July 2017 and December 2018. This award is one of seven categories of the Seifsa Awards for Excellence. In a statement issued on Sunday, Seifsa indicated that, as economies develop and grow through industrialisation, the quality of natural resources such as water and air tend to deteriorate as companies thrive. “The adverse relationship between economic growth and ecological deterioration is a cause for great concern and dictates that companies should do everything it takes to ensure that they continuously rehabilitate and restore the environment to its natural form to preserve it for generations to come,” Seifsa CEO Kaizer Nyatsumba said. He indicated that it was important for business to take the initiative by employing available technologies to ensure that any damage to the environment by their operations is minimal. “It is for this reason, among others, that Seifsa established the Seifsa Awards for Excellence in 2015. The awards celebrate companies which take seriously the ecological challenges that confront the world and take the necessary steps to ensure that the natural environment is preserved.” Members operating in the metals and engineering sector are encouraged to submit their entries for all seven award categories at www.seifsaawards.co.za, before April 26. The awards are open to all companies in the metals and engineering sector. Award winners will be honoured at a ceremony to be held at the IDC Conference Centre, in Sandton, on May 23.
