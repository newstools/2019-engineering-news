Eskom has said that stage 2 load-shedding will continue until Sunday and the risk of power cuts remains high until the middle of next week. The national power utility said the cuts were due to a shortage of generation capacity caused by plant breakdowns and the need to manage diesel and water resources. "The system outlook for next week further indicates a high risk and that up to Stage 2 load-shedding may be implemented until the middle of next week," a statement from the power utility read. Stage 2 load-shedding is being implemented for Friday and is expected to continue until 23:00. Eskom said that load-shedding is implemented rotationally, as a last resort, to avoid a blackout.
