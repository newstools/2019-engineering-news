Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi on Thursday emphasised the importance of proper maintenance and facilities management in the property sector. In a speech delivered during the Department of Public Works’ inaugural Real Estate Capacity Building colloquium, in Pretoria, he cited the newly opened Booysens Magistrate’s Court as an example of the importance of proper facilities management. He noted that it was good to have a new, high-quality building, but, if the facilities management is neglected, chaos will reign; which he lamented was a problem that was confronting government. Further, Nxesi extolled that the court had been built within budget and on time. He also pointed out that it had been built by a 100% black-owned company. Nxesi said he highlighted this to dispel the perception that black-owned companies are corrupt, especially in the property and construction sectors. He stated that “corruption knows no race”. Nxesi mentioned that, following the colloquium, ideas and discussions at the event should be built on. The two-day colloquium aimed to provide valuable information to guide and direct the department’s scope of real estate management for the construction and property sectors.
