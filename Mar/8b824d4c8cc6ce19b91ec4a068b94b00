The average dam levels in the Western Cape have improved significantly year-on-year from 20.3% in the corresponding week last year, to 40.5% this week. However, water levels are lower than the 41.9% recorded last week. Dams supplying the City of Cape Town have decreased week-on-week from 54% to the current 52.7%, but this remains a significant improvement on the 23.2% reported in the same week in 2018. The Theewaterskloof dam, which was only 10% full at this time last year, declined week-on-week to 40.8% full, while the Voëlvlei dam was down week-on-week from 67.4% to 65.6% and up on last year’s 15.5%. The Bergriver dam registered 73.7% full this week, compared with 49.6% in the corresponding week in 2018, and 75.1% last week. Clanwilliam dam also decreased week-on-week from 37.4% to 33.4%, compared with 8.1% in the same period last year. “It is normal to see dam levels dropping over the hot and dry summer months, as has been the case again this past season. We are hopeful of another good winter rainfall period, but only time will tell,” said Western Cape Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning Minister Anton Bredell. “In the interim, we continue to urge responsible water use, even in areas where there may be more water.”
