The Imperial Logistics construction structural collapse inquiry will go on recess and reconvene on June 18. The Department of Labour (DoL) in January launched an investigation into the causes of the roof collapse of a building, which was under construction on the premises of Imperial Logistics, in Jacobs, Durban. The collapse led to the death of four people and the injury of four others. The DoL inquiry decided to action a recess on Friday when a construction site principal agent was supposed to testify, but the other parties’ legal representatives asked for more time than was allocated to acquire certain information. BACKGROUND On March 28, 2018, a precast roofing company, Echo Prestress, was busy installing concrete precast roof slabs, when the structure collapsed. The DoL’s inspectors had issued a prohibition notice to Imperial Logistics, stopping any further work from being undertaken until the circumstances and root cause surrounding the collapse were investigated. The inquiry started gathering testimony on February 23, at the KwaZulu-Natal Master Builders Association offices, in Westville, while the second session started on March 4. The inquiry, initiated by DoL chief inspector Tibor Szana, is investigating levels of adherence to occupational health and safety (OHS) standards and negligence that might have contributed to the injuries and deaths. DoL OHS specialist Sandile Kubeka has been appointed the presiding inspector of the inquiry. To date, 23 witnesses have been interrogated. At least four witnesses will be expected to testify before the inquiry concludes its work.
