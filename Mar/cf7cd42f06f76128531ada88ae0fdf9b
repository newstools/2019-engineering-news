There is no magic formula to solve the current load-shedding crisis and the Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan is unable to say when the rotational blackouts will be over. Gordhan was briefing the media on Tuesday, along with senior Eskom officials as the country entered its fifth consecutive day of Stage Two to Stage Four load-shedding. “At this point in time, we are still getting a better grasp of the technical problems,” Gordhan said. He said investigations are underway by the technical review task team and independent engineers on a voluntary basis and cannot comment yet when load-shedding will be over. Gordhan promised another update about the power system, once they have a better grasp of the system in the next 10 to 14 days. “It’s going to be a huge struggle to overcome this crisis. We want to give the public as much information as we can so that all of us have very similar pieces of information,” Gordhan said. He admitted that government had not communicated “adequately” with the public and promised to do better in this regard in the days ahead.
