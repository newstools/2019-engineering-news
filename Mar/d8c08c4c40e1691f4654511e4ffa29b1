State-owned electricity company Eskom warned on Wednesday that the risk of rotational powercuts to ease pressure on the grid remained high. Cash strapped Eskom, which supplies about 95 percent of South Africa's electricity, has struggled to meet demand and was forced to implement rolling blackouts for several days last month to avoid tripping the national grid. "The risk of load-shedding remains high for today as the system is still tight and vulnerable. Load-shedding will only be implemented if absolutely necessary," it said on Wednesday. Eskom urged residents and businesses to switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to help reduce demand.
