Black-owned investment holding company Thesele Group has, through a substantial equity transaction, acquired a 35% stake in South African water and wastewater solutions provider Talbot & Talbot. Concluded this month, the transaction is in support of Talbot & Talbot’s growth objectives and represents a strategic addition to Thesele’s diverse portfolio. “In addition to enabling us to make a significant, positive change in the empowerment of Talbot & Talbot, our partners at Thesele bring with them a broad network, valuable strategic input and access to capital to fuel the growth of the business,” Talbot & Talbot CEO Carl Haycock said in a statement published on Thursday. He added that, beyond enabling Talbot & Talbot to achieve the milestone on its transformation agenda, Thesele shares every aspect of the company’s vision. Thesele executive director Oliver Petersen said Thesele identified water infrastructure as a strategic investment theme and was drawn by Talbot & Talbot’s water and wastewater management solutions that have been implemented at numerous facilities across Africa. “We are excited to partner with a highly qualified and experienced management team at Talbot & Talbot that is dedicated to leading the way in providing water recovery and wastewater treatment solutions to both private and public sector clients in South Africa and other markets where Talbot & Talbot is active,” he added.
