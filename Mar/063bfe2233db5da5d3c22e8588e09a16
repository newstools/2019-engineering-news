Edward Kieswetter has been appointed as the Commissioner for the South African Revenue Services (Sars) for a term of five years, starting on May 1. The process for the appointment of the Sars Commissioner was guided by the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into Tax Administration and Governance by Sars, chaired by retired Judge Robert Nugent. The other shortlisted candidates who were invited to the final interviews were Nathaniel Mabetwa, Sunita Manik, Gene Ravele, Nazrien Kader and current acting Sars Commissioner Mark Kingon. Kingon was appointed acting Sars Commissioner in March 2018. President Cyril Ramaphosa officiated Kieswetter’s appointment following a recommendation from Finance Minister Tito Mboweni earlier this week. Kieswetter, a former Alexander Forbes CEO and former Sars Deputy Commissioner, was the recommended candidate by an independent selection panel, which was chaired by former Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, and included Angela Bester, Justice Dennis Davis, Sindi Mabaso-Koyana, Ismail Momoniat, Thandi Orleyn and Fesekile Tshiqi. According to the President, Kieswetter “has the experience, integrity and skills required to turn Sars around by restoring revenue collection, redirecting operations toward innovation, developing future leaders for the organisation and restoring Sars’ credibility and integrity”.
