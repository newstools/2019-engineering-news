City of Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba on Monday opened two newly built and rehabilitated roads in Ivory Park, Ward 78, near Midrand. The R6-million project, which was funded by the Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA), included the installation of underground stormwater management systems and interlocking blocks on the sidewalk path of the road, since stormwater and blocked drains contributed to the deterioration of roads. The JRA had appointed consultancy, CivEc, to design and supervise the construction of the project, while it appointed Phagama Civils as the contractor for the road reconstruction and rehabilitation and the stormwater management installation. The upgrades, which started in June 2018, along Haile Selasie and Masimbambisane streets, entailed the resurfacing of 640 m of road, the installation of 40 m of stormwater and the cleaning of 200 m of stormwater pipes. Mashaba earmarked R15-million for road rehabilitation in Ivory Park, with upgrades in Wards 110 and 111 to follow within the next six months, with anticipated completion by September. Transport MMC Nonhlanhla Makhuba said the Ward 78 project employed 21 labourers from the local community, while nine local small, medium-sized and microenterprises were appointed as subcontractors. More local employment and business opportunities will follow in the Ward 110 and 111 upgrades. Mashaba said the City of Joburg has a mammoth task of completing R11-billion worth of infrastructure backlogs, with only an R8-billion budget that should be split across roads, electricity and water infrastructure, which makes thorough project management imperative with these kinds of projects.
