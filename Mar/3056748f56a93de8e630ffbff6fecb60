The Defence and Military Veterans Minister has announced the cancellation of a meeting scheduled to take place on Tuesday with her counterpart from neighbouring Mozambique, which has been hit by the deadly Cyclone Idai that has left a trail of death and destruction. "Owing to unforeseen circumstances, please note that the consultation meeting between Minister [Nosiviwe] Mapisa-Nqakula and her Mozambican counterpart, Atanáº¯sio Salvador M'tumuke, scheduled for Tuesday, 19 March 2019 at 10:00 has been cancelled," said the defence department in a terse statement. "We apologise for any inconvenience caused and thank you for your understanding." Latest reports from Mozambique estimate that as many as a 1 000 people may have lost their lives and more than 90 percent of the city of Beira had been destroyed by the devastating hurricane, which hit that country late Thursday. Zimbabwe has also suffered loss of lives recorded at 89 and major damage to roads and bridges in the eastern parts that border Mozambique.
