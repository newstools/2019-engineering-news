Almost 70% of service providers have been paid following an investigation, launched by Public Works and Infrastructure Minister Patricia de Lille, into the nonpayment of invoices within the stipulated 30-day period. These payments were made within four working days. As of July 22, the department had 2 084 unpaid invoices relating to contractors in areas including Cape Town, Durban, Kimberley, Mmabatho, Mthatha, Polokwane, Tshwane, Johannesburg and Mbombela. To date, 1 390 of the invoices have been paid, to the value of more than R102-million. A further 694 payments are yet to be processed. Major construction projects and day-to-day maintenance constituted 94% of all unpaid invoices that had gone beyond 30 days, with other default areas including telecommunications service providers and car rental agencies. Commenting on the progress that has been made since she launched the Consequence and Contract Management Systems last week, De Lille on Wednesday said she would continue to monitor these payments daily and make available a progress report to all South Africans.
