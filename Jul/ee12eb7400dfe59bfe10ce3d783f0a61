The department of water and sanitation has reiterated its commitment to transparency and to empowering the residents of the West Coast district municipality duringÂ the raising of the Clanwilliam dam wall. Officially launched last October, the project is one of the biggest government infrastructure projects in recent years in the Western Cape and entails raising the dam wall by 13 m. The additional yield of water will help the emerging farming community of the West Coast in particular and is also poised to create much needed jobs and skills for young people, with over 50 having been employed since the launch. The department of water and sanitation will from time to time engage the communities of West Coast about the project, spokesperson Sputnik Ratau said. "In a free society, transparency is government's obligation to share information and be accountable to citizens and ensure that they are empowered with information," he said. The department said following recent rains, the Western Cape water supply system consisting of the six largest dams had increased by over two percent and was currently standing at 52.59%.
