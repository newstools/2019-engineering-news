Funding provided by the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) has helped start-up recycling company Mihula Holdings increase its staffing levels to eight people. The IDC in March provided funding to enable Mihula to buy a baler and trucks for collecting raw material. Mihula, situated in Highveld Industrial Park since July 2018, shreds and bales paper, cardboard, plastic bottles and glass. Mihula CEO Amelia Mkhonza on Friday said the business started in a backyard and, with initial help from the National Youth Development Agency, it was able to buy a shredder and secure more recycleable material from companies in eMalahleni, where the industrial park is based. The IDC’s investment has allowed the business to grow even further. IDC Mpumalanga regional manager Mashweu Matsiela said the company’s investment focus in the province was in manufacturing, tourism, agriculture and mining. It has investments in a fresh produce market, a dehydrated foods plant and mining contractors. Next, the IDC will provide funding for a hotel to open in the Kruger National Park, while it is also involved in a new specialty chemicals plant that will be built in the eMalahleni area.
