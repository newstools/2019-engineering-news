JSE-listed paper and pulp producer Sappi has become an International Stakeholder member of the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). This membership aligns with Sappi’s focus on sustainable forest management and responsible procurement throughout its supply and value chains. “Credible, internationally recognised, robust forest certification systems like PEFC are fundamental to Sappi’s commitment to sustainability. “These systems give assurance to our value chain of the origin of our woodfibre and responsible forest management practices,” comments Sappi CEO Steve Binnie. “Given that stakeholder engagement underpins our approach to doing business at Sappi, we welcome the opportunity to become a PEFC International Stakeholder member. “Through voting in PEFC´s general assembly and joining working groups and committees, we look forward to sharing our expertise and contributing to the mission of the PEFC,” says Sappi sustainability and investor relations head Graeme Wild. He adds that the collaboration reinforces Sappi’s contribution towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), particularly SDG 15 – Life on Land; given its common priorities to promote sustainable forest management and support smallholder forestry around the world. The PEFC is also increasingly becoming an important forest certification option in South Africa, responding to customers’ requests for PEFC-labelled products. Sappi has, in recent years, been collaborating with national stakeholders to develop a national forest certification system. These efforts have resulted in the establishment of the South African Forest Assurance Scheme, which has recently been assessed and endorsed by the PEFC.
