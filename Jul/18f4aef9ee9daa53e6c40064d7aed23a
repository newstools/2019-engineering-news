Following 42 years of public service, Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) deputy director-general responsible for strategic and emergency projects Trevor Balzer has called it a day. He is retiring after serving in different capacities within the DWS since 1995. He joined the public sector in 1977. He boasts extensive experience in both water services provision and water resource management and represented the DWS on water matters in Africa and globally. In 2007, he was appointed special adviser to then Water and Environmental Affairs Minister Lindiwe Hendricks and, in 2009, as COO of the department. He is a Fellow of the South African Institution of Civil Engineers and a Fellow of the South African Academy of Engineering. “I really value the time spent at the DWS, in particular the friendships that I have made in the entire family. “Remember that South Africa is depending on you to make sure that we have water security and dignified sanitation services to 2030 and beyond. Do not rest until you can declare that indeed we have universal access to water and sanitation services,” Balzer commented.
