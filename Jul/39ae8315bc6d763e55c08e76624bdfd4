Between 800 and 20 000 locally manufactured parts were used in every locally assembled vehicle model in 2018, the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (DTIC) says. It noted in a Parliamentary reply published this week that, vehicle models that have been in production for longer use more locally sourced parts. These locally manufactured components and parts also find their way into export markets for fitment into the assembly of vehicles, as well as domestic and foreign replacement and aftermarket parts. Vehicle models that used the most locally produced parts in 2018 were Toyota’s Hilux and Fortuner, BMW and Ford with 2 635, 3 298 and 20 217 parts, respectively. In value terms, the local vehicle assemblers sourced local components or parts to the value of R51.1-billion in 2018. Components or parts worth R51.3-billion were exported from South Africa, with catalytic converters (37.5%), engine parts (8.1%) and tyres (5%) being the top three exports.
