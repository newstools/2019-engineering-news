Pretoria-based developers Twin City Development will build Vryburg’s first enclosed shopping mall, situated in North West. Dubbed Twin City Vryburg, the R290-million development is expected to change the face of retail in the town, with around 70 stores, three anchor tenants, restaurants and service outlets to be housed at the 20 000 m2 mall. Twin City Development COO Ryno de Leeuw expects the mall to open in the first quarter of 2021. Twin City Vryburg is the company’s second development in the North West, with the Rustenburg Mall set to open in 2020. The Vryburg mall will have a primary catchment area of more than 14 500 households, while there are 23 000 additional households in its secondary catchment area. Twin City Development has a portfolio of ten shopping centres, spanning more than 250 000 m2 of gross leasable area.
