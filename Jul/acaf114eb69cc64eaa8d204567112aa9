Environment, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Barbara Creecy has confirmed that her department has initiated a process to review the effectiveness of current policies relating to the management of plastic waste and whether it is necessary to consider a new policy direction. In a Parliamentary reply published this week, the Minister said the review process would be concluded within the current financial year. This was in response to a question by Democratic Alliance MP Annerie Weber, who asked whether the Minister intended to ban the use of singe-use plastic in South Africa. Creecy said it was a matter of public record that the management of plastics in the world generally, as well as in South Africa, was suboptimal, which would need an appropriate response “if we are to protect our oceans”. She highlighted statistics published by the World Economic Forum that said there would be more plastics than fish, by weight, in the ocean by 2050 if action was not taken immediately. The current policy review that the department has undertaken includes discussions with the retail, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries, as well as the paper and packaging industry, on ways to combat the use of single-use plastics and its disposal.
