Enel Green Power South Africa this week started construction on its 140 MW Garob wind farm, near Copperton, in the Northern Cape. This is the group’s fifth wind project in the country, operating as a renewable subsidiary for energy multinational Enel, and will cost around €200-million to build. The project is expected to generate around 573 GWh/y from 46 turbines once fully operational in the first half of 2021. The project will avoid emissions of around 600 000 t/y of carbon dioxide. Enel Green Power head Antonio Cammisecra said that, with the start of construction at Garob, the company had reached yet another important milestone in South Africa, following the start of construction at the Oyster Bay wind project. “Alongside boosting renewables growth in South Africa, we are focusing our sustainability activities on scientific education, which significantly contributes to the skills needed for power industry professionals, with a view to supporting local expertise. “Looking ahead, we will continue to break ground on the projects we were awarded in South Africa and to launch shared value initiatives for local communities, while scouting for further sustainable growth opportunities in the country’s renewable industry.” Enel Green Power will develop five wind energy projects, for a collective 700 MW of capacity, that were awarded in round four of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme. Its other round four wind energy projects include the 140 MW Karusa and the 140 MW Soetwater wind plants, also in the Northern Cape, as well as the 140 MW Nxuba and 140 MW Oyster Bay wind plants, in the Eastern Cape. Enel Green Power has more than 520 MW of wind and solar capacity in operation in South Africa.
