Global law firm DLA Piper has published an updated version of its Africa Renewable Energy Guide, which provides a snapshot of the regulatory environment for renewable energy in 17 African countries, including South Africa. The second edition of the publication guide showcases the diverse approach to renewable energy being adopted across the featured countries. The guide also outlines the legal, economic and technological developments under way in Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. DLA Piper notes that renewable energy is already delivering electricity to millions of Africans for the first time and argues that there is potential for significant further growth. “The African continent is rich with the resources needed to produce renewable energy, including solar – there is an estimated 10 TW of potential capacity or more. “It is therefore unsurprising that many investors, developers and entrepreneurs continue to prioritise African markets and the vast and diverse opportunities which they represent for the renewable-energy sector,” DLA Piper states.
