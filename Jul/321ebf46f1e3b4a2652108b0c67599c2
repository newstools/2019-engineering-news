Using single widebody tyres on trucks, as opposed to a dual-tyre assembly, can save transport operators up to 5% on fuel costs. “Some studies show this can be up to 12%,” says University of Illinois professor of engineering Imad Al-Qadi. This saving is linked to rolling resistance, or the interaction between the pavement and the tyre. Pavements with less rolling resistance boost fuel consumption significantly. Al-Qadi notes that, at 100 km/h, aerodynamic drag consumes around 40% of a truck’s fuel, while mechanical loss is responsible for around 25% of fuel consumption. Rolling resistance accounts for around 35% of fuel consumed, which is quite significant. In Denmark, researchers are trying to reduce fuel consumption by 8% by changing the texture of the road surface, in an effort to reduce rolling resistance, notes Al-Qadi. Al-Qadi spoke at the Southern African Transport Conference, held in Pretoria this week.
