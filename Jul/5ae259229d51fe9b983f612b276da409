The Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works has started building a pedestrian bridge on the N2 at Garden Village, in Somerset West, just before the intersection with De Beers avenue. The department expects the R22-million project to be completed by the end of 2020. The need for the bridge arose as learners from Gordon High School and Danie Ackermann Primary School, as well as other pedestrians, cross the road during peak traffic times. The Western Cape government says the bridge will be a major safety improvement for both pedestrians and motorists travelling on the N2. The 48-m-spanned bridge will have a structural steel arch and concrete deck. Construction activities will have a limited impact on commuters on the N2.
