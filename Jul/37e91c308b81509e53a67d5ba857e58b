Proflight Zambia on Thursday announced plans for a new scheduled route between Ndola and Johannesburg, a move it said would boost trade and investment between the two cities. The new service, expected to begin on September 2, will link the Copperbelt mining and industry hub with South Africa’s economic capital with flights on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, the airline said. “We are excited to launch the new Ndola to Johannesburg route to give travellers another reliable connection. The route will be Proflight’s third international destination, adding to Durban in South Africa and Lilongwe in Malawi,” Proflight Zambia sales and marketing manager Barbara Namwila said in a statement. “The introduction of the new route adds additional convenience and provides a Zambia-based option on the route, which we hope our local travellers will support." The airline said the two-and-half hour flights to and from Johannesburg on Proflight’s 50-seat CRJ jet aircraft would make it an efficient and reliable choice for business, leisure, friends and families to travel. Proflight has operated in Zambia for 28 years, playing a significant role in facilitating tourism and growing the aviation sector.
