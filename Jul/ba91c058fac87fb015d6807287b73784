From its launch at the Paris Air Show in mid-June to the end of that month, Europe-based global major aerospace group Airbus’ latest airliner, the A321XLR, has been ordered or selected by 14 airlines and one leasing company, with firm orders totalling 44 aircraft. Letters of intent cover another 205 aircraft, giving a total of 249, of which 112 are conversions from previous orders. The most recent customers for the type are Ireland’s Aer Lingus (to acquire six) American Airlines (with 20), Spain’s Iberia (eight) and Australia’s Qantas (ten). The XLR in the aircraft’s designation stands for extra long range. This new version, which is planned to enter service in 2023, will have a range of up to 4 700 nautical miles (about 8 700 km), 15% greater than the range of the current A321LR (long-range) version. It will also deliver 30% less fuel consumption per seat than previous generation competitor types. Airbus describes its newest offering as “the A320neo jetliner series’ next evolutionary step, responding to market needs for even more range”. (The suffix -neo stands for new engine option.) The A321XLR will be the world’s longest-range single-aisle airliner. The A321XLR has been designed to have minimal changes and maximum commonality with the A321LR and the wider A320neo aircraft family. The changes that have been made are those required to provide the extra long range and an increased revenue payload. During last month the airframe manufacturer also received firm orders for another 86 members of the A320neo family. This number was made up of 73 A320neos and 13 A321neos, split among four airlines. The group’s other single-aisle airliner family is the smaller A220 series (originally the Bombardier CS100 and CS300). June saw two airlines place orders for 15 of the longer, A220-300, version of the aircraft. In terms of deliveries of single-aisle airliners last month, the group handed over 54 A320 family aircraft (composed of both conventionally-engined and -neo variants) to customers, as well as six A220s. On the wide-body side, ten A350XWBs were delivered, composed of both A350-900 and A350-1000 models, plus five A330neo types and one A380.
