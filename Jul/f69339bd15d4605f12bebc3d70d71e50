The board of South African Airways (SAA) on Tuesday expressed its support for the appointment of Nico Bezuidenhout as CEO of its subsidiary, Mango Airlines, effective October 1. This appointment of a permanent CEO at Mango was a further step in stabilising leadership and strengthening the executive capacity of the group, SAA said in a statement released on Tuesday. “We are pleased to welcome Nico Bezuidenhout back into the SAA group,” commented SAA chairperson JB Magwaza. “His appointment will advance the implementation of the turnaround strategy of [the] SAA group,” he added. Bezuidenhout in mid-2016 resigned as CEO of Mango to take up the position of CEO at regional airline fastjet. He has also, on a number of occasions in the past, held the position of interim CEO at SAA.
