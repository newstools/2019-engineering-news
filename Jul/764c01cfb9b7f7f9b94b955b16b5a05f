The Royal Academy of Engineering has invited entries for its Africa Prize for Engineering. The prize aims to stimulate, celebrate and reward innovation and entrepreneurship in sub-Saharan Africa. The academy stated on Tuesday that the entries were open for individuals or small teams, living and working in sub-Saharan Africa. Entrepreneurs from all engineering disciplines, with an innovation that can provide scalable solutions to local challenges, are invited to enter by July 22. Shortlisted applicants for the Africa Prize will receive a six-month package of tailored support to help them achieve commercial success from their innovation. The overall winner will be awarded Â£25 000 at a high-profile event in June 2020. The 2019 winner Neo Hutiri was the first-ever South African engineer to win the prize, for his Pelebox medicine dispensing system.
