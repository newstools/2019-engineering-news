State-owned power utility Eskom has announced that Unit 3 at its Medupi power station has attained commercial operation, which ensures technical compliance to statutory, safety and legal requirements. Unit 3 is the fourth Medupi unit to reach commercial operation, with Units 6, 5 and 4 already commercially contributing electricity to the national grid. Eskom on Friday applauded the Medupi team, under the leadership of Medupi Power Station GM Phillip Dukashe, and its execution partners, noting that the “remarkable progress” came after intensive continuous testing activities and shared dedication. “Commercial operation of Unit 3 is a major milestone that signifies that Medupi is nearing its completion; therefore, it cannot be taken lightly,” Eskom COO Jan Oberholzer commented. “Eskom, as the engine room of South Africa, must ensure electricity supply for the economic growth of the country and Unit 3 has contributed greatly to that cause,” he added. Eskom noted that Unit 3 was distinctively different in that it was the first of the last three Medupi units and was supported by the auxiliary plant systems from the northern side of the site, as well as the new control and instrumentation system. These systems, as well as the new interfaces, resulted in “significant challenges” different to those experienced with the first three units.
