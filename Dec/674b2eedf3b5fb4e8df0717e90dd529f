A new apron belt feeder for run-of-mine (RoM) and stockyard applications offers the strength of an apron feeder with the spillage control of a conveyor system. The belt-over-apron feeder has a low-profile loading deck and a modular design, for adjustable-rate feeding of abrasive materials such as mineral sands, iron-ore and bauxite, in midtier RoM applications and stockyard management operations. The low-profile loading deck accommodates different types of loading methods, including direct truck tipping, side tipping, front-end loading, dozing and RoM bypass tips, in order to prevent double handling. The feeder’s modular design allows for transportation within a standard-size container, aimed at simplifying freight solutions to remote locations. Modularity also allows for specific discharge heights, depending on the required application. In addition, the  feeder is semi-mobile, facilitating on-site relocation or repositioning. The feeder design incorporates a number of safety features, including a start-up alarm that is located behind the wing walls, an emergency stop on either side of the feeder and an emergency bar at the feeder opening. The Hybrid Apron Belt (HAB) feeder is part of FLSmidth’s range of feeders, feeder breakers and sizers.
