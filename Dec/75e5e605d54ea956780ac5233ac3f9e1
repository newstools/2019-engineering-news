The Nuclear Industry Association of South Africa (Niasa) announced, on Tuesday, that it had appointed a new president, with effect from this month. He is Professor Itumeleng Mosala. The association has also appointed two special advisers to its board, namely Dr Pali Lehohla and Silas Zimu. “Prof Mosala is well positioned to lead the nuclear industry as it navigates the shark infested waters of the energy sector, in South Africa and worldwide,” stated Niasa in its press release. “The three new additions will inject new blood into the association.” Mosala was Westinghouse Electric (South Africa) regional VP from 2010 to 2016. He also served as director-general in the Department of Arts and Culture. He served on the Ministerial Task Team on the creation of a National School of Government. He obtained his PhD from the University of Cape Town. “His academic track record is illustrious,” said Niasa. “He brings on board a wealth of experience and wisdom, highly needed in the energy sector.” “Among his key vision insights for Niasa are the ability to foster an industry identity and to act together for and in the interests of the industry,” affirmed the association. “To be able to achieve this, it is imperative for participants to understand the industry markets and how they relate to other industries. It is important to cultivate self-understanding of the industry in the wider economy and how the latter impacts on it.”
