President Cyril Ramaphosa cut short his state visit Egypt so he could return home and meet with utility Eskom, local news agency EWN said on Tuesday, over a deepening power crisis that has seen six straight days of nationwide blackouts. Opposition political party, the Democratic Alliance, and labour union Uasa had earlier called on the President to cancel his trip to Egypt and deal with the power situation.
