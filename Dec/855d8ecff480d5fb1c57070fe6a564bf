Eskom will return to Stage 4 loadshedding from 10am on Monday after losing more generating capacity, the power utility said. "We regret that due to additional loss of units at our power stations, Stage 2 loadshedding will move to Stage 4 loadshedding as from 10:00 to 23:00," the company tweeted on its official account. Eskom began implementing Stage 4 loadshedding for the first time last week, but scaled back to Stage 2 over the weekend. Stage 4 allows it to cut up to 4,000 megawatt - about a tenth of overall capacity - of demand off the national grid to avoid a collapse of the system. The company has said continuous rain over parts of the country has affected its coal stocks, compounding a crisis caused by unplanned breakdowns at power plants.
