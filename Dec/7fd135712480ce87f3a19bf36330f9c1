By 2050, nearly two-billion people living in cities will suffer from water shortages, as demand for water will increase by up to 70%, says the World Bank. In light of this, the City of Cape Town, in partnership with pump manufacturer Grundfos, will host a W12 Congress, which will produce a framework for ongoing collaboration across sectors to strengthen water governance and develop sustainable water solutions. The conference will be held in Cape Town from January 29 to 31. Among the attendees will be the International Water Bank, which is a W12 strategic partner, to actively engage with companies and government to identify projects and initiatives that they could invest in. Other organisations that will attend include the World Bank, the Alliance for Water Stewardship, Stockholm Water Week, the International Water Bank, the International Desalination Association and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. W12 aims to create the framework for the first “Major City Best Practice Water Protocol” and to raise awareness about the impact of climate change and the role of cities and citizens in finding solutions for resilience in a water-scarce world. “The responsibility of making sure the world preserves and has enough water is not solely the responsibility of government and municipalities but a combined effort from the public, corporate businesses and authorities globally,” organisers W12 Congress said in a statement on Tuesday.
