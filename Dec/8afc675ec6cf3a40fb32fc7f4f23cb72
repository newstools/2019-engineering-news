Dual-listed miner Sibanye-Stillwater has been recognised as the most collaborative and water saving company in the South African mining industry at the yearly Rand Water awards, which took place last week. The award recognises Sibanye for its positive contributions and willingness to assist, as well as the positive contribution it made to water conservation and water demand management initiatives. Commenting on the award, group CEO Neal Froneman said the company was “heartened” for being recognised for its ongoing efforts to responsibly manage water resources in the areas in which Sibanye operates. The initiatives fall in line with the company’s focus on intensifying its environmental, social and governance efforts across the group.
