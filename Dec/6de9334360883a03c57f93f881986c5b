No load shedding is expected on Wednesday, State-owned power utility Eskom confirmed. This is owing to a decrease in demand during the holiday period alongside the return of some generating units to the service. Eskom on Wednesday said that it would continue to use emergency reserves to supplement capacity, if necessary, over the holiday period. However, the utility emphasized that as the system continues to be vulnerable and unpredictable, “the possibility of load shedding remains”. “Our technical teams will continue to work over the holiday period to monitor the situation and to work at reducing unplanned breakdowns to below 9 500MW to enable us to minimise the risk of load shedding,” the utility said.
