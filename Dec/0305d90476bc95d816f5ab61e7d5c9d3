Multinational electrical equipment supplier Schneider Electric has launched a new tool, the mySchneider Partner Portal, for use by residents and small building electrical contractors. Small electrical contractors can gain reward points for buying qualifying products and will receive 300 welcome points to start with when they register on Schneiderâ€™s website, as well as an additional 150 points when they upload their first invoice. The points earned will be converted to cash and loaded onto the mySchneider electrician card. Schneider offers all the wiring devices needed to electrify a standard house. Further, the mySchneider application offers tailored services, access to its catalogue, expert support and information.
