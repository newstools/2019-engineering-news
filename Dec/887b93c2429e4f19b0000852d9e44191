Atmospheric water generation technology company Aqua Air Africa has unveiled its new atmospheric water generating plant in Ga-Rankuwa, Pretoria. The plant, which is aimed at tackling the critical scarcity of potable water in South Africa, produces 10 000 l/d of clean potable water from air daily, with plans to increase this to 100 000 l/d. A subsidiary of Moipone Group Investments, Aqua Air Africa aims to deliver a sustainable water technology solution to help address South Africa’s looming water shortages. “The water-generating technology commissioned by Aqua Air Africa uses industrial- and municipal-scale water-generating units to extract humidity from the air and collect it in raw water storage tanks,” explains CEO Keamogetswe Matsho. The water enters a multi-filtration system to remove impurities and particles, following which it is processed through an ultraviolet sterilisation system and ozonation to inhibit the growth of micro-organisms. “The result of this process is chemical-free purified water with all natural minerals,” he says. “Environmental realities, such as rising temperatures and scarce rainfall, are having a severe impact on the availability of drinkable water, as is a lack of investment in water infrastructure and maintenance,” Matsho says. Aqua Air Africa aims to partner with government and nongovernmental organisations to provide drought- and disaster-stricken areas and vulnerable people with safe, mineral-rich potable water that is easily accessible. “Key to the company’s success is the partnership with the community of Ga-Rankuwa, where the company has created much-needed jobs and continues to use the services of local small, medium-sized and microenterprises,” he concludes.
