The Airports Company South Africa has announced the appointment of Nompumelelo (Mpumi) Mpofu, currently the director-general (DG) in the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation in the Presidency, as its new CEO. Her appointment would take effect from February 1, Acsa said this week, noting that Mpfo is joining the partially State-owned organisation at a time when it is “charting a fresh course for its future”. Former CEO Bongani Maseko’s contract was not renewed in November 2018. According to the Acsa statement, Mpofu has extensive experience spanning over 25 years in the fields of transport, infrastructure development, local government and town, urban and regional planning. In her career of public service, Mpofu has held the position of DG in the departments of Defence, Transport and Housing. She has served on the boards of the Municipal Demarcation Board, the National Housing Board, the Gauteng Development Tribunal, the National Housing Finance Corporation and the National Home Builders Registration Council. During her tenure as DG in the Department of Transport, Mpofu ensured the development, implementation and monitoring of transport policies and strategies in fields including aviation, rail, maritime, road transport, search and rescue. She was also the leader of the Government Transport Plan for the FIFA World Cup 2010 and oversaw Acsa’s airport development and redevelopment programme for 2010. “Mpofu was instrumental in the development and approval by Cabinet of the South African Airlift Strategy which seeks to expand the country’s air transport services and to apply a holistic approach to global aviation opportunities to support South Africa’s interests,” the statement noted. Mpofu holds an honours degree in urban and regional planning and a graduate degree in town planning from Coventry University in the UK, as well as a certificate in local government management from Oxford University.
