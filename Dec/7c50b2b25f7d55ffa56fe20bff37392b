Mozambique's central bank expects its gross domestic product to rise to 4% in 2020 thanks in part to rebuilding efforts after two devastating cyclones this year, its governor Rogerio Zandamela said on Monday. "This forecast is based on post-cyclone reconstruction actions, debt settlement to state goods and services providers, increased credit to the private sector and investment in the oil and gas sector," he said during a year-end speech. He added that inflation was expected to remain in the single digits although slightly above the level seen this year.
