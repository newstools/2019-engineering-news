The retail price of both grades of petrol sold in South Africa will rise by 22 cents a litre from Wednesday while the wholesale price of diesel will dip by as much as 15.95 cents, a statement from the mineral resources and energy department said on Tuesday. The department said the retail prices of illuminating paraffin, still used by some poor people for cooking and lighting, would fall 24 cents. South Africa adjusts fuel prices each month, taking into account global prices and the rand exchange rate.
