Mineral sands producer Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) has won the Top Employers Institute’s Top Employer of the Year award for the fourth year in a row. The top employer certification recognises organisations that successfully demonstrate an exceptional human resources (HR) environment and employee offerings. The heavy mineral sands extraction and refining company, which is a subsidiary of diversified miner Rio Tinto, outperformed the certified average top employers in the areas of talent strategy, workforce planning, performance management, leadership development and career and succession management. The institute assessed companies on their ability to attract, develop and nurture talent, as well as continuously improve employment practices. “Top employers not only provide value through learning and development initiatives, but they also offer highly effective programmes for employees at all stages of their career,” RBM MD Werner Duvenhage said in a statement issued on Tuesday. He added that human progress was at the core of RBM’s purpose and that attracting, developing and retaining the best people were crucial to its future success. “As pioneers in mining and metals, we produce materials essential to human progress. Our values influence how we work together, how we perform and how we stay safe. We care about each other, we achieve together, we listen, we do what is right and we set high standards.” A quarterly survey through which employees voice their needs and concerns is performed to improve on organisational culture and practices at RBM. RBM HR business partner Bridgette Ngobese said employee wellbeing extended beyond safety and that a healthy lifestyle through participation in sporting activities was being encouraged through various programmes.
