Transnet Engineering on Friday delivered the last batch of 100 locally manufactured freight wagons to Caminhos De Ferros De Mocambique (CFM), a Mozambique State owned railway operator. The handover event was held in Uitenhage in the Eastern Cape, the company said. In a transaction valued at over R250-million, Transnet Engineering was in December 2018 contracted to manufacture and deliver 300 freight wagons to CFM to support Mozambique's growing strategic industries. Transnet Engineering acting divisional executive: maintenance & services Andile Silo said: “The very nature of this contract underlines how TE strives to grow its footprint in Africa, Middle East and South Asia. This handover is therefore historic and a key milestone in the relationship between the two countries.” Accepting the final order, director of operations at CFM, Teodomiro Angelo said: “Today’s delivery will contribute to the region’s plans and enable CFM to perform an uninterrupted intra-trade and efficient railway system and facilitate rail integration throughout the continent.” Transnet Engineering is the advanced manufacturing division of Transnet. The company manufactures freight wagons, coaches, port equipment and locomotives as well as provide maintenance services.
