The government of Flanders, the northern federated state of Belgium, has granted €1-million to the Africa Climate Change Fund to support five projects in Malawi, Mozambique and South Africa, according to the African Development Bank (AfDB). In a statement, the AfDB said the new contribution brings the total contribution to the fund to €11.4-million, after an initial grant of two millions euros in November 2016 by the Flanders government. In Malawi, the money will go towards the “demonstration of an innovative results-based finance model for adaptation to climate change” and will be implemented by the climate change and green growth department of the AfDB. In Mozambique the grant will support two projects implemented by the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Institute of International Economic Cooperation, while in South Africa it will support the ecosystem-based adaptation and financing for livestock farmers within the country's threatened grassland. The Africa Climate Change Fund has supported African countries in their transition towards climate resilient and low-carbon development through a portfolio of eight on-going projects.
