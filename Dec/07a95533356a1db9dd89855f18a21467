Pan-African telecoms group Liquid Telecom South Africa has inaugurated the landing station of the Melting Pot Indianoceanic Submarine System (Metiss) at Umbogotwini, in KwaZulu-Natal. The project followed an agreement in 2018 with a consortium of telecommunication companies, including Canal+ Télécom, CEB Fibernet, Emtel, SRR and Telma. Liquid Telecom South Africa, which has provided the landing station in KwaZulu-Natal, says the high-speed connectivity project will be completed and operational by July 2020. “This partnership with Liquid Telecom is an important step for connecting people and economies of the Indian Ocean islands to South Africa which is among the major Internet hubs in Africa,” says Data Centres Southern Africa GM for Africa Dr Angus Hay. Liquid will host and manage the submarine cable while also providing fibre backhaul to Teraco.
