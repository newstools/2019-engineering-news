Three development institutions have partnered to present a digital application at the Conference of the Parties 25 climate conference, in Madrid, this week, to help African countries that are grappling with implementing key global initiatives. The United Nations Development Programme, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the African Union Development Agency have named the application the Guide for Integrated Planning in Africa. The guide helps to align the Sustainable Development Goals, the African Union Agenda 2063, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States into African countries’ national development plans. The guide is available as an app and in handbook format. However, the app makes it easier for African planners to search for and apply tools for developing a new generation of national development plans. AfDB climate change director Anthony Nyong says good planning tools enable streamlined work, while better planning facilitates efficient resource allocation. He affirmed the bank’s commitment to working with regional member countries to mainstream the global development agenda in national development plans, with the ultimate goal of ending poverty, generating jobs for youth and protecting the planet.
