South Africa recorded smaller foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in the third quarter compared with the second quarter, but portfolio investment inflows jumped after the government issued international bonds, central bank data showed on Friday. Africa's most industrialised economy had FDI inflows of R17-billion in the third quarter from inflows of R26.3-billion in the second quarter, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) said in its Quarterly Bulletin. The portfolio investment inflows were at R40.2-billion from July to the end of September from inflows of R10-billion in the prior quarter, mainly reflecting the government's issuance of international bonds of $5-billion, the SARB said.
