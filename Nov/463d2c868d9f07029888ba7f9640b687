From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: Rail components manufacturer Alstom Ubunye last month inaugurated its 80 000 m2 modernised factory, in Nigel, Gauteng. Marleny Arnoldi tells us more about the site. Marleny Arnoldi: The factory was established in 1957, and was acquired by French multinational Alstom in 2016 to form the Alstom Ubunye local company. The company then modernised the facility to cater for a contract it has with the Gibela Rail Transport Consortium, for the supply of components equivalent to 150 trains. In turn, Gibela is supplying 600 trains to the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa to replace South Africa’s ageing Metrorail fleet. Alstom Ubunye CEO Xavier Boisgontier tells us more about the company. Alstom Ubunye CEO Xavier Boisgontier: Marleny Arnoldi: The Alstom Ubunye factory employs 565 people across nine workshops with local manufacturing capabilities. The facility also uses two automated welding robots complementing 100 certified welders in the facility. Boisgontier explains the activities on site. Alstom Ubunye CEO Xavier Boisgontier: Marleny Arnoldi: Alstom Ubunye was in the process of ramping up to full nominal mode, which will see it supply 62 bogies and end under frames, 20 traction cases, 10 static converters and looming and passenger information systems each month to Gibela. Boisgontier shares some details of the contract.
