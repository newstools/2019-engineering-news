Eskom has warned that it will begin regular scheduled interruptions to three municipalities in the Free State, including the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality where Bloemfontein is, unless it gets paid for the provision of electricity. The other two affected municipalities are the Mafube and Mantsopa local municipalities. The power utility, in a statement, said the municipalities had repeatedly failed to honour the payment of their electricity accounts. They will begin facing scheduled power interruptions between 06:00 and 20:00 on weekdays and weekends from December 3.
