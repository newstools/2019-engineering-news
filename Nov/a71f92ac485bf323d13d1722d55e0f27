Power utility Eskom said on Tuesday it did not expect to implement rotational powercuts although the system remained constrained, with generating plants performing at very low levels of reliability. Years of inadequate maintenance of its infrastructure have left Eskom's generating units vulnerable to breakdowns, forcing the state entity to implement load-shedding several times this year to avoid tripping the grid. "With unplanned breakdowns that are above 10 500 MW as at 06h00, the probability of load-shedding remains, but will only be implemented if absolutely necessary," Eskom said on Tuesday. "There is sufficient diesel for our open cycle gas turbines and water at the pumped storage schemes to supplement the shortage of capacity, if required. The Emergency Response Command Centre (ERCC) continues to monitor the system closely." It reminded electricity consumers that any unexpected shift, such as additional unplanned breakdowns or the unavailability of diesel for open cycle gas turbines or low water levels at the pumped storage schemes, could result in load-shedding at short notice. "A concerted collective effort to reduce demand can help to lessen the level of load-shedding. And as such, we strongly urge customers to assist by helping to reduce demand by using electricity sparingly," Eskom said.
