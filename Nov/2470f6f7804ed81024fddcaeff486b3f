ELB Engineering Services is assembling two mobile ship loaders, which it supplied to Transnet Port Terminals (TPT), at the Saldanha Bay multipurpose terminal. The ship loaders, which feature telescopic booms, will be used in combination with the double-sided mobile truck unloading system at the terminal. Both these systems are independently mobile, allowing for quick movement on and off the quay, allowing TPT the mobility it requires for positioning the machines, says ELB. ELB worked with its technical partner Telestack, based in Ireland, on the supply of the two mobile ship loaders, and is working with local engineering company Westarcor Engineering during assembly. Westarcor will supply all the required equipment and labour for the assembly of the machines. The first ship unloader arrived on site in 11 containers, with assembly having started in July. Further, ELB will also be responsible for the installation and commissioning of the ship loaders.
