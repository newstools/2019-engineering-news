The South African military ombud office welcomed its newly appointed Military Ombud, Lt Gen (Ret) Vusumuzi Masondo at a swearing in ceremony on Friday at SAMHS Training Formation in Thaba Tshwane. Masondo has replaced Lt Gen (Ret) Temba Matanzima who served in the position for aseven years, after his appointment by President  Cyril Ramaphosa. Masondo will serve in the position for seven years. High Court Judge Lettie Molopa-Sethosa officiated the ceremony and the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans  Nosiviwe Mapisa Nqakula gave the keynote address. Mapisa Nqakula told those in attendance that the new military ombud had to ensure that the office enforced its mandate. “Most important thing is the protection of the fundamental rights and freedom of members of the armed forces, and ensuring that there is minimisation of the violation of human rights,” Mapisa Nqakula said. She said to Masondo that in his new role, he should remain ever-cognisant of the institution’s independence and impartiality, ensuring that justice was delivered to serving or retired members, as well as the South African public. Masondo said he was ready to take his place and make sure that all the cases in the office were dealt with without fear, favour or prejudice. “The prevention of maladministration and human rights violations is essential in a democratic society. This prevention relies, in part, in the existence of a security sector that is both transparent and accountable,” Masondo said. He said the office had been given sufficient mandate by the Military Ombud Act, and it was incumbent upon him and the staff to carry out the mandate with due diligence.
