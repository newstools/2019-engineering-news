Water and Sanitation Deputy Minister David Mahlobo on Friday raised concerns about the lack of back-up electricity capacity at the Rooiwaal wastewater treatment works, which has left large parts of Hammanskraal without reliable water supply for weeks. The treatment works was struck by lightning on October 18, significantly impacting on the treatment of wastewater. This had happened while the treatment works was being revitalised by the Department of Water and Sanitation and the City of Tshwane to increase its working capacity. Mahlobo said the water shortages had been enormous, with particularly negative effects on the farming community. On top of unreliable water supply, Mahlobo said he had also been informed that samples of the water supplied indicated that it contained groundwater contamination. “There are certain sectors that are affected such as health and education facilities. This is even worse because of the heatwave. We should, therefore, intensify our efforts to supply water to communities by means of water tankers and also ensure people know when and where this will happen,” Mahlobo noted. He added that the department, in conjunction with the City of Tshwane, would ensure that a delivery service model was implemented as a way of notifying communities affected by water interruptions, particularly in terms of the times for delivery and delivery points.
