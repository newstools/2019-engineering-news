Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu and her counterpart from the Kingdom of Lesotho, Minister Samonyane Ntsekele, on Wednesday visited Mokhotlong, Lesotho, for the sod-turning in preparation for Phase II of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP II). The ceremony was also attended by a representative of the local chief, the South Africa High Commissioner to Lesotho, members of the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority, the Lesotho Highlands Water Commission, members of Parliament from Lesotho, members of the water departments of both Lesotho and South Africa, as well as the local community. Both Ministers emphasised the importance of the LHWP II and how it continues to cement the very solid relations between the people and governments of both countries. Ntsekele emphasised the huge benefits, infrastructure development and hydro-electricity generation, accruing in the main to Lesotho, as well as monetary benefits through royalties. For Sisulu, security of water supply for the Integrated Vaal River System (IVRS), as well as benefits for the Free State, Mpumalanga and North West, was important. "Even in the face of climate change challenges, droughts and uncertainty of weather patterns, the two countries will continue to cooperate for the good of both peoples that we serve. “We shall continue to endeavour to ensure that this critical project attains all its ideals,” she said.
