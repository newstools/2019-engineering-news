JSE-listed Taste Holdings has entered into an agreement to sell its Maxi's and The Fish & Chips Co businesses to an undisclosed buyer. This is in line with its strategy to sell its food businesses and focus on its luxury goods businesses, which include NWJ, Arthur Kaplan and World's Finest Watches. Taste on Tuesday said it expected the sale of Maxi's and The Fish & Chips Co to become effective on or about December 2. Earlier this month, it announced the sale of its Starbucks franchise in South Africa to an undisclosed buyer for R7-million.
