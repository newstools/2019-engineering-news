The supply of electricity to the South Sudanese capital Juba has been boosted by the launch of a 100 MW power plant that will supply electricity to the capital and surrounding areas. The African Development Bank (AfDB) is funding the power plant which is located in Mangala Country and operated by Ezra Construction and Development Group. Launching the power plant on Thursday, President Salva Kiir said he was optimistic the plant would boost the country’s post-conflict recovery efforts after over five years of civil war, the Sudan Tribune reported. "Today marks the beginning of the new era. This is not time for war, but development and service delivery,” he said. Following the outbreak of the civil war in December 2013 government-owned power facilities were badly affected with many forced to close due to operational costs.
