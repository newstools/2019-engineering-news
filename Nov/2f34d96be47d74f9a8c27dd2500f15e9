A group of South African businesspeople, representing 35 companies, will be heading to Mozambique on Sunday in search of investment and trade opportunities. The group will participate in an Outward Trade and Investment Mission to Pemba and Maputo organised by the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition from November 24 to 29. The objective of the mission is to increase bilateral trade and investment between South Africa and Mozambique by exposing South African companies to opportunities available in Mozambique. Deputy Trade and Industry Minister Nomalungelo Gina will lead the mission. The specific focus of the mission will be on designated industrial and infrastructure projects as envisaged in the memorandum of understanding on economic cooperation between the two nations. These include the liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in the Northern Cabo Delgado province; electricity generation, transmission and distribution systems; water supply systems; transport infrastructure such as ports, rail and roads; and industrial development zones. Steel Tube Export Association of South Africa executive director Keitumetse Moumakoe says his main objective for travelling to Mozambique is to identify tubular products that South African manufacturers can supply to the gas exploration projects. Metals fabrication company Clotan Building Systems export manager Jardus Smith says Mozambique will be rolling out one of the biggest LNG projects in Africa and it is incumbent upon companies on the continent to ensure that the bulk of the content of that project is African. Mozambique is South Africaâ€™s third-largest trading partner on the continent. Total trade between the two countries had grown from R43.9-billion in 2013 to R52.4-billion in 2018. South African companies, State-owned enterprises and small, medium-sized and microenterprises have invested more than R90-billion across various sectors in Mozambique between January 2003 and March this year.
