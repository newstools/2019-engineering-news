Steel producer ArcelorMittal South Africa's (AMSA's) liquid steel production decreased by 18.2% year-on-year to 1.06-million tonnes in the quarter ended September 30, mainly as a result of planned production curtailments to adjust volumes to lower demand. AMSA's capacity utilisation was 65% in the quarter under review, compared with 85% in the September 2018 quarter. Domestic steel sales decreased by 16.9% year-on-year to 737 000 t as a result of weak demand, higher imports and customers driving down their stock levels. AMSA's export sales, however, increased by 50.7% year-on-year to 324 000 t.
