The South African Wind Energy Association (SAWEA) on Wednesday announced the appointment of three new members – Mark Tanton, Dhesen Moodley and Toni Beukes – to its board of governance. The existing members are Tobias Niemz, Katherine Persson, CEO Ntombifuthi Ntuli and Mercia Grimbeek. The board is mandated to steer the wind energy sector and advocate for a clean and affordable energy mix, of which wind is a big part, while South Africa is undergoing an energy transition. The board will usher SAWEA into the newest procurement rounds of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP), as well as operationalise the industry commitment statement that is focused on transformation and economic development. Tanton was involved in the establishment of SAWEA and brings with him governance and industry experience, while having been one of the first developers to pave the path for wind energy in South Africa. Beukes is an attorney and has 12 years’ experience in the energy sector. She previously worked for the REIPPPP, where her responsibilities included contract management, transformation strategy and board administration. Moodley brings 20 years of investment industry experience, including 13 years managing infrastructure funds investing in Africa. His experience in South African renewables started with a wind farm development in 2008, prior to the REIPPPP. He has been involved in four REIPPPP bid windows since. “The new board members add a diversity to the leadership of the organisation as they bring new sets of skills and experience critical for the successful operation of the association,” said Ntuli.
