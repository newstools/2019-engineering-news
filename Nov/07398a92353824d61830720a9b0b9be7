Dubai's DP World has signed a preliminary agreement with the Nara Namib Free Economic Industrial Zone to develop a dedicated business park in the Namibian port town of Walvis Bay. The park will be a 'free economic zone' for industry and logistics and initially cover an area of 50 ha, according to a statement on Dubai's government media office website on Tuesday. The park could eventually be spread across 1 500 ha, it said. A free economic zone is often a dedicated area that has different laws or rules, such as fewer or no taxes, designed to attract investment. DP World and Nara Namib aim to reach a final agreement in the second quarter of 2020, the statement said.
