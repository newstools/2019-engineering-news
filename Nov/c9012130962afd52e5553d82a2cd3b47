Alex van Niekerk has resigned as the South African National Roads Agency Limited’s (Sanral’s) planning, transportation and toll manager to pursue another career opportunity. His last day will be February 28, at which point a successor or acting manager will be named. Until then, Sanral’s executive management team will continue to oversee the process of permanently filling the position. The agency said on Wednesday that it “is confident that together with Van Niekerk it will make this a smooth transition for clients, partners and all relevant stakeholders”. Van Niekerk joined Sanral as project manager in 1998, and has since then helped with traffic management, contributed to building Sanral’s toll division and building strategic partnerships with complementary partners in the road construction sector both within the country and the South African Development Community region, the statement said. For the past 14 years, Van Niekerk was responsible for the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project and worked to improve and stabilise the operations of Sanral’s electronic tolling unit.
