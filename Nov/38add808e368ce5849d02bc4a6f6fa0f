Engineering and construction services provider Murray & Roberts (M&R) on Friday said it and its advisers did not agree “in many respects” with the analyses, conclusions and recommendations contained in the administrative report issued by the Department of Labour (DoL) relating to the collapse of the Grayston pedestrian bridge temporary works in October 2015. M&R and other parties that participated in the DoL’s inquiry into the bridge collapse, on Tuesday received a copy of the presiding inspectors’ report, which made findings regarding alleged transgressions of health and safety statutory obligations “by various parties, including M&R Construction, a former subsidiary of M&R”. The report was prepared for and addressed to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief Inspector of the DoL for their consideration and was confidential, M&R informed shareholders on Friday. It added that all costs relating to this matter had been previously accounted for and that no further financial impact was expected.
