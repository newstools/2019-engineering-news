Toll route manager Trans African Concessions (TRAC) has expressed concern about a truck backlog between the Komati Load Control Centre and the Lebombo Border Post over the past few weeks. The backlog is negatively impacting on the N4 toll route. TRAC has met with Lebombo Border Post’s management and other stakeholders to address the problem. It has also approached the South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) to assist in the matter before the seasonal festive traffic starts increasing towards the border. TRAC says the truck traffic build-up is not a new dilemma on this part of the route; however, truck traffic volumes have increased considerably since September, following Transnet’s temporary halt of its rail service to the Maputo port. This has resulted in a 30% increase in trucks travelling through the border post. The subsequent traffic queues of up to 7-km-long have obstructed traffic flow and blocked farm and business entrances. TRAC believes the backlogs will decrease if the clearing of trucks at the border post improves. Additionally, the agency says an expansion is overdue at the Komati Load Control Centre, which is managed by TRAC and owned by Sanral. “This should include the expansion of the facility through the addition of a second lay-bye and improvements to the access road. TRAC offered to assist with a project of this nature a few years ago, but this was declined. “To alleviate some of the current frustration, TRAC has agreed to erect a four-way stop at the Komatipoort/Sasol garage intersection, which should improve vehicle movement across the intersection.”
