Transnet National Ports Authority’s (TNPA’s) dredging services division has embarked on a maintenance dredging campaign at the Port of Cape Town to ensure the port provides safe navigational channels and berthing facilities for shipping. TNPA will remove about 20 000 m3 of sand and sediment with the Italeni grab hopper dredger and the Isandlwana trailing suction hopper dredger during the exercise, which will restore the design depths leading from the basin to the berths, as well as the berth areas alongside South East Quay in the basin. The dredging maintenance will also address localised high sports along the long quay in the port’s Dunan Dock area. TNPA states that multi-beam bathymetric surveys will be conducted at regular intervals throughout the campaign to ensure all areas within Duncan Dock are restored to their original design depths. The two dredgers that will be used complement each other in that the Isandlwana is built for high-speed sailing to the offshore disposal site, while the Italeni improves the accuracy of the final dredged depths.
