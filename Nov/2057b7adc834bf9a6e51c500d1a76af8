Sasol Exploration and Production International (Sasol E&PI) aspires to extend its gas supply from southern Mozambique into other Southern African countries and West Africa. “We will progressively grow our exploration and production portfolio in Africa, with West Africa representing a key pillar of our upstream strategy. We have already developed extensive subsurface and above-ground insight in the region,” says Sasol E&PI senior VP Gilbert Yevi. The group has invested more than $3-billion in Mozambique on day-to-day operations and social investments, contributing to Mozambique’s gross domestic product and national fiscus through taxes. “Sasol has sustained more than 300 permanent jobs since inception across various businesses, while 90% of Sasol Mozambique’s workforce are Mozambicans. Sasol has also committed to a 71% procurement spend with Mozambique-owned suppliers and a 50% reduction in spend with foreign suppliers,” notes Yevi. Further, Sasol holds a 30% nonoperating interest in the Etame Marin Permit, offshore Gabon. The Etame 9P appraisal well was successfully drilled to a total depth of 3.1 km and discovered additional oil in both the Gamba and Dentale oil sands. “This successful Etame 9P is the first of many appraisal opportunities that have been identified as the potential to create substantial organic value growth for our shareholders. The well adds additional resources between 2.5-million to 10.5-million barrels of oil as published by Vaalco our partner and operator of the fields,” Yevi highlights. Sasol remains focused on delivering value through safe operational execution and hopes its work in Mozambique and Gabon are the first of many steps towards its goal of organic production and reserves growth in Africa.
