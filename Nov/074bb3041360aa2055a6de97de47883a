Empowered mining company Seriti Resources has concluded an agreement to acquire a majority interest in diversified miner South32's South African Energy Coal (SAEC) business. In exchange for its 91.835% interest in SAEC, South32 will receive a R100-million cash payment upfront, as well as 49% of the free cash flow generated by SAEC until March 2024. The latter component will be limited to a maximum of R1.5-billion a year. “Finalisation of this transaction will be a significant milestone for Seriti in our ambition to become a black-owned and controlled mining champion. “The SAEC acquisition will enable us to offer further secured, long-term coal supply solutions to Eskom as a demonstrable commitment to sustainably supporting South Africa’s energy needs. The combination of our energy coal businesses will realise further operational and technical efficiencies enabling us to better service our customers by offering competitive energy solutions," says Seriti CEO Mike Teke. South32 CEO Graham Kerr says the sale of its interest in SAEC will enable the business to continue to operate "safely and sustainably into the future for the benefit of its employees, customers and local communities, consistent with South Africa’s transformation agenda”.
