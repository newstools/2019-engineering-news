The Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) says it is addressing “serious truck traffic congestion” in the Port of Durban’s Bayhead precinct, which began on Tuesday and continued overnight into Wednesday morning. Consequently, TNPA has arranged for the urgent deployment of the South African Police Service and the Durban Metro Police, as well as terminal operators, to assist in the alleviation of the traffic backlog. TNPA on Wednesday said a significant number of employees working across the terminals and depots in the Bayhead and Island View precincts had reported being unable to access their workstations on time for duty. In turn, this led to delays in landside operations which were having a knock-on effect on waterside operations. To overcome this challenge and minimise the impact on operations, TNPA has deployed its waterside craft to ferry employees from the Point precinct to the Bayhead and Island View precincts. TNPA has also activated its business continuity plan and will keep shipping clients and terminal operators updated regularly on efforts to normalise operations. Additionally, the statement on Wednesday said that Transnet was also aware of an electronic message circulated by transport companies this week calling for a boycott of the Durban harbour and urging truckers to park off at their depots from 06:00 on Thursday, November 28, until 18:00 on Monday, December 2. Such blockades limit access to both Bayhead and Langeberg roads, the statement said, warning that this impacted on the receiving of trucks and landside operations, disrupting economic activity, frustrating neighbouring communities and threatening jobs. Transnet has been working closely with industry bodies to address valid issues raised but has appealed for transport companies to engage through the appropriate channels to remain up-to-date on ongoing mitigation measures implemented by Transnet and the progress thereof.
