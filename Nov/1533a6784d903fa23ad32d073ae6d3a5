State-owned arms manufacturer Denel achieved record distances and unmatched accuracy during long-range artillery testing, in the Northern Cape, last week. Tests of long-range guns manufactured by Denel Land Systems, and ammunition produced by Rheinmetall Denel Munition, were conducted at the Alkantplan Test Range. The testing involved reaching targets at an average range of 76.2 km. Denel CEO Danie du Toit said in a statement on Tuesday that this was a new milestone in the long-range artillery capability of Denel. “The test results exceeded expectations, both in the distances achieved and accuracy. It underscores Denel’s reputation in the design and manufacturing of world-class artillery and the manufacturing of ammunition that enables the guns to reach long range targets with unrivalled precision,” he stated. The main artillery systems used during the testing were the G6-52 self-propelled gin-howitzer and a German PZH2000 mounted gun. The ballistic system is based on the technology developed in the late 1990s and has been consistently improved over the past two decades. “The artillery produced by Denel Land Systems is still considered to be the yardstick against which all other long-range systems are measured,” said Du Toit. The projectiles used for the tests were velocity-enhanced artillery projectile ammunition designed and manufactured by Rheinmetall Denel Munition for high-firing pressures and muzzle velocities.
