South African Airways (SAA) has made a new offer to unions in a bid to avert a looming strike at the national flag carrier. Phakamile Hlubi-Majola, the spokesperson for the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa), said on Thursday morning that the new offer would be put to the union members at a meeting set to start at 14:00. "I cannot tell you the details of that offer. We only ever communicate offers once they have been agreed to an finalised," she said. About 3 000 members of Numsa and the South African Cabin Crew Association are planning to start a strike in the early hours of Friday morning at SAA and SAA Technical.  The struggling State-owned airline, in turn, has scrapped all domestic, regional, and international flights on Friday and Saturday, with the exception of a few international flights. SAA previously said that a strike could endanger the future of the airline and threaten jobs.The group's acting CEO Zuks Ramasia, said earlier in the week that the airline had offered the unions a 5.9% salary increase subject to the availability of funds. The national carrier also announced on Monday that it is embarking on a restructuring process which may affect up to 944 jobs - almost a fifth of its employees. Unions want an increase of 8% across-the-board wag, job security for at least three years, and the in-sourcing of more staff.
