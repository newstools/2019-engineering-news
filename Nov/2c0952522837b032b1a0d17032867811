The average dam levels in the Western Cape have increased as a result of summer rains across large parts of the province during the past ten days. The latest average dam level for the province as a whole increased from 63.9% during the comparative week in 2018, to 66.8% currently. The City of Cape Town’s dams are, on average, 84.2% full. “The increased levels are reassuring but the concern about the situation in the Karoo and the West Coast is uppermost in mind,” comments Western Cape local government, environmental affairs and development planning Minister Anton Bredell. “The overall picture is good; we have not seen these comparable levels for many years, but the downside is that there has still been very little to no relief in drought-stricken areas of the Karoo and the upper West Coast.” Provincial government interventions continue to provide support such as the allocation of additional money towards fodder relief for farmers with livestock, besides others. Bredell urged the public to use water responsibly and sparingly, even in the areas where there are no current shortages.
