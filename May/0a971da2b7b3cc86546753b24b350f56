The African Refiners and Distributors Association (ARA), together with the Egyptian General Petroleum Company, will in mid-June host an interactive workshop on the impact of the International Maritime Organisation’s changes to regulation around the sulphur content of ship bunker fuel across Africa from January 2020. ARA executive secretary Jol Dervain explained in a statement that the changes to the regulations are the most significant changes in the refining, shipping and ship bunkering industries in decades, adding that the ARA, with its partners, will discuss the practical implications across the complete bunkering supply chain from crude oil through to refining and the logistics chain. “Preparation, planning and increased transparency between supplier and vessel will be essential. This is a major change in commercial relationships,” said ARA specifications work group leader Evans Mauta. The ARA said the workshop would bring together global experts to discuss the implications of, and preparations for, the regulatory change for refiners, storage companies, bunker fuel operators, shipping companies and ship owners.
