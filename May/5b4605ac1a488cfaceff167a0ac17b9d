South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa) CEO Phumzile Tshelane has been dismissed from his post and removed from the State-owned organisationâ€™s board. This was announced on Tuesday by Energy Minister Jeff Radebe in a short press release. The decision was made because of the serious charges brought against Tshelane, coupled with a resolution by the Necsa board. It was also based on the recommendation of a disciplinary panel. The dismissal was with effect from May 11. Radebe said his decision was taken in terms of Sections 17 (1)(c) and 22 (4)(c) of the Nuclear Act (Act 49 of 1999). The press release added that the Necsa board would commence advertising soon to start the recruitment process to fill the vacant board position. The candidates would require the necessary expertise and skills to guide Necsa into the future and ensure its sustainability and growth.
