Cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab plans to open a new office in Kigali, Rwanda, to support the rapid growth of its business in East Africa. This strategic move will provide more room for development, as well as closer proximity to new partners in the region, allowing Kaspersky Lab to continue its expansion into the promising African market.
 
“Governments and enterprises across Africa need an integrated approach to complex threat detection and response as they fight cybercriminals who have significant financial resources and are constantly looking to exploit any vulnerability,” says CEO Eugene Kaspersky.
 
Kaspersky Lab Middle East, Turkey and Africa MD Amir Kanaan adds that the company sees great potential in the African market.
 
“Nations across the continent are adopting new technologies to facilitate and enhance the way they do business. While a few years ago it was enough to have a strategy to prevent infection, today businesses have to be able to detect when they are infected or hacked, predict hacker behaviour and respond to attacks quickly to ensure minimal damage and impact. We can support in achieving this,” he says.
