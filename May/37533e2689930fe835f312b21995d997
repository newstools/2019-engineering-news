Keabetswe Mpane has been appointed president of supply chain management professional body Sapics. Having served as a director of Sapics for five years, Mpane asserted that she had the experience, energy and determination to propel the association into a new era of professionalism and transformation. Supply chain management is increasingly recognised as a driver not just of organisational competitiveness, but also of thriving economies. “The professionalisation of supply chain management has never been more critical than it is today, in our increasingly global, challenging, complex and dynamic business environment,” Mpane stressed, noting that one of her priorities as president would be achieving professional designations for African supply chain professionals. Transformation also tops her agenda. “Bringing transformation to this challenged industry will contribute to the economic revitalisation our country,” she stated. Mpane is Transnet Rail Engineering’s head of department for logistics and compliance. Two new directors, Nat Maelane and Werner Pelser, have also been invited to join the Sapics board. Sapics directors elected to the board at the association’s recent annual general meeting are MJ Schoemaker and Kamogelo Mampane. Richard dos Santos has also been re-elected to the Sapics board, while Sorab Mullan and outgoing Sapics president Mungo Park will retain their positions as directors. Colin Seftel and Tracy Cheetham’s terms as directors came to an end this year, while Ralton Moses retired from the Sapics board owing to work commitments.
