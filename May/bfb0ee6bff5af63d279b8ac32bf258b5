As South African Express (SA Express) continues to strengthen its operational efficiency and governance systems, the State-owned airline is preparing to lay fraud and corruption charges against some of its former executives. SA Express chairperson Tryphosa Ramano said in a statement on Thursday that the decision to charge some of the former executives stemmed from a forensic investigation that “flagged a number of prejudiced transactions”. “All allegations involving fraud, corruption and other irregularities demand a robust and prompt response, as well as the severest of sanctions against [identified] parties,” he said. The flagged transactions include multimillion-rand cases of alleged collusion with service providers, manipulation of procurement processes and irregular payment or overpayment of suppliers.
