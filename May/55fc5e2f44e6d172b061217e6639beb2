The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) this week reminded road users that the M2 motorway between the Crown interchange and Maritzburg street remained closed for rehabilitation works on the bridge. The full closure will remain in force until the end of October. The closure was necessitated by continuous monitoring and the bridge’s visual condition assessments indicating that the structural integrity of the concrete elements are “severely reduced”. Since the closure of the M2 bridge at the end of February, JRA had demolished 90% of the failed bridge structural elements and milled and exposed asphalt to allow for further drainage investigation.
