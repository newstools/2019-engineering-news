The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) says it has handed what it calls a "comprehensive submission" to the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that allegedly details corruption, money laundering and fraud at State-owned freight utility Transnet. In addition to allegations that have surfaced regarding Transnet’s 1064 locomotive contract, Outa says it has corroborating evidence about other contracts that show alleged dubious dealings between Transnet and other corporations. “We are confident that Transnet chairperson Popo Molefe will confirm what is in our report while testifying at the inquiry. Our submission shows that kickbacks worth billions [of rands] were given to companies owned by key individuals,” Outa transport portfolio manager Rudie Heyneke alleges. The submission took about six months to compile and is a combination of Outa’s own investigation into the Gupta email leaks, whistleblower information and reports compiled by other interested parties. Outa is confident that the submission handed to law enforcement agencies will enable them to speed up their investigations and to act against the implicated persons in the near future. Meanwhile, Outa continues its investigations into the Gupta leaks and Heyneke says the investigation team receives new information and evidence daily.
