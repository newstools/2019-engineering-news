The Innovation Hub will, on May 23 and 24, host the 2019 International Association of Science Parks (IASP) Africa division workshop at its grounds in Tshwane. The workshop is part of a series of Science and Technology Parks (STP) build-up events that are taking place globally ahead of the main IASP conference in France, in September. The workshop will be hosted under the theme ‘The Role of STPs and Areas of Innovation (AoIs) as enablers for economic development’, the main objective of which will be to challenge practitioners from the continent to consider the economic development capacity of STPs and AoIs in Africa. The workshop will be officially opened by Innovation Hub chairperson Dr Tshilidzi Ratshitanga, who will be joined by IASP director-general Luiz Sanz and IASP Africa division president Alan Boshwaen. That will be followed by three plenary sessions and will culminate in a gala dinner that evening. According to a statement issued on Friday, each forum has been curated to engage matters deemed critical to the role of STPs and AoIs, particularly in Africa, namely the policy environment for STPs; best practice of business incubators; entrepreneurship and economic growth; and the Fourth Industrial Revolution in Africa. IASP will also elect and announce its fifth president for the IASP Africa division at the workshop.
