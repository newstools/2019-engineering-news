The La Lucia mall, in KwaZulu-Natal, is undergoing a major upgrade that will modernise its retail space. The mall has undergone eight extensions and five major mall upgrades since it first opened its doors in 1974. Its most recent major upgrade was in 2003. The latest upgrade project began in January and is scheduled for completion in October. Wilson Bayly Holmes-Ovcon is the main contractor for the upgrade and Bentel Associates International the architect. Bentel designed the La Lucia mall in 1972 as a 12 000 m2 shopping mall and has been involved in each of its expansions, taking it to its current size of about 40 000 m2. Externally, a neutral colour palette has been chosen to enhance the building. The entrance design is being simplified to make entry points to the mall easily identifiable. Feature signage walls have been introduced and placed strategically to optimise the visibility and legibility of retailers’ signs. For the interiors, the aim is to enhance the shopping experience with a seamless design using fluid lines and the understated elegance of a neutral colour scheme. The traditional marble floor is being replaced with a patterned porcelain tile to create interiors that are subtler and visually less structured. New timber ceiling elements will also add warmth and texture. The Mall’s refurbishment is ecofriendly, with all its lighting being replaced with more energy efficient fittings. The mall’s new public toilets will also move away from the traditional functional space to a more inviting atmosphere. The La Lucia mall is one of Growthpoint Properties’ core retail assets. “La Lucia mall has proven a strong asset and we are pleased to undertake this well-appointed upgrade,” says Growthpoint Asset Management: Retail head Neil Schloss.
