The Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has suspended all diving operations and angling activities within the Durban port, owing to a severe sewage discharge that poses a risk to diving personnel and marine life, it said on Friday. The discharge stems from the failure of pumps at the eThekwini municipality’s Mahatma Gandhi pump station. The municipality had taken the pumps out of commission and was awaiting the arrival of spare parts from overseas for repairs. “The Port of Durban was unfortunately on the receiving end of the large volume of litter, effluent and sewage that was discharged through the stormwater reticulation system from a catchment area of more than 200 km2 in size,” TNPA said in  a statement. TNPA’s environmental department appealed to port users for their cooperation as the city acts to repair the pumps; in particular, the suspension of diving will have an impact on companies using the repair quays within the port’s ship repair precinct.
