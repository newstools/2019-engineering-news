Business Unity South Africa (Busa) on Monday urged all employers, including its members, to encourage workers to exercise their right to vote in the 2019 national election on May 8. While political parties wrap up their campaign for the hotly contested sixth general elections since the dawn of democracy, Busa appealed to operating businesses to make it possible for employees to exercise their right to vote, on Wednesday. Busa said the democratic right to vote was an important signal of a healthy democracy and an active citizenry. Speaking to Polity, Busa said it was hoping that the sixth administration would create conditions for growth and prosperity and policy certainty. It also hoped for an efficient administration and State-owned enterprises, as well as an active respect for the rule of law. “We wish the IEC, as well as election observers, well as they shoulder the noble responsibility to ensure that the electoral authority conducts a credible, and free and fair election. We wish the country’s citizens, and all political parties, the best in South Africa’s quest towards a successful sixth democratic election,” Busa said.
