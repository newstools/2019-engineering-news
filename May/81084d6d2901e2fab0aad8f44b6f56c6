The Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) was, on Wednesday afternoon, granted a court interdict against a planned strike by mariners who are members of the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu). Satawu on Tuesday announced that its members, including pilots who move the ships in and out of port, tug masters who assist pilots in moving the ships in and out of port and chief marine engineers who maintain the ships and operate the engines, would down tools at all of the country’s ports from 17h30 on May 29. The intended strike action was as a result of an unresolved “dispute of mutual interest” that exists between the TNPA and its marine personnel who are members of Satawu. “We would like to assure our customers and stakeholders of our commitment to provide a seamless service to the industry,” TNPA acting CE Nozipho Mdawe said in a release issued late on Wednesday. The TNPA management will closely monitor port operations to prevent any potential disruptions to shipping movements.
