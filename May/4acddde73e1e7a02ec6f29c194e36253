Johannesburg- and London-listed Kibo Energy’s Benga power plant project, in Mozambique, is advancing “well ahead” of its development schedule, CEO Louis Coetzee said on Thursday, reporting that the definitive feasibility study (DFS) for the coal-fired power station had been presented to the Energy Ministry and power utility Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM). “Working in Mozambique has been notably straightforward as evidenced by the timely advancement of Benga,” said Coetzee, adding that the support and feedback it had received on the 65%-owned Benga project had been “highly encouraging”. The 150 MW to 300 MW power station would be fed by regional coal producers. The company is in negotiations for a power purchase agreement with EDM and potential private offtakers. The project is a joint venture with Termoeléctrica de Benga.
