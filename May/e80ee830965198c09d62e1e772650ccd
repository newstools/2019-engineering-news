The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) has placed the company’s chief strategy offer Dr Sipho Sithole; its legal, risk and compliance head Martha Ngoye and executive in the office of the group CEO Tiro Holele on special leave. The decision follows ongoing investigations into allegations of improper, irregular, corrupt, and fruitless as well as wasteful expenditure by various employees of PRASA at all levels of the organisation. The suspension of these executives is to ensure “a fair process based on a principle of innocent until proven guilty”, the agency said in a statement on Wednesday.
