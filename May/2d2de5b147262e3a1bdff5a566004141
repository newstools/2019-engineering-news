Dual-listed MiX Telematics’ subscription revenue increased by 18% year-on-year to just under R1.7-billion for the financial year ended March 31. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue increased by 16.3%. Benefitting from an increase of 73 600 subscribers from April 2018 to March 2019, an increase of 10.9%, the company’s subscription revenue also benefitted from a higher average revenue per user. The solid results follow after the  mobile asset management solutions provider upwardly revising its long-term adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margin target to over 35% in January, compared with 25.8% in fiscal 2018. Adjusted Ebitda was R602.8-million, compared with R441.9-million for fiscal 2018. The upward revision comes on the back of margins expanding by almost 500 basis points to 30.5% and record positive free cash flow of R177-million. Total revenue for the period was R1.9-billion, an increase of 15.4% compared with revenue of R1.7-billion for the prior comparable period.
