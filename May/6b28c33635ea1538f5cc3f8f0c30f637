The Durban Car Terminal has broken a South African record, handling over 500 000 fully built units (FBUs) in the 2018/19 financial year. “A combination of a shift in the operating model, improved planning, dedicated operational teams and collaboration with customers and shipping lines have seen the terminal exceed its annual average of 480 000 FBUs,” Transnet Port Terminals GM for bulk, breakbulk and car operations Amanda Siyengo said in a release published on Wednesday. This has resulted in the terminal handling 510 936 FBUs, comprising passenger, commercial, static mafi cargo and high and heavy vehicles during the financial year.
