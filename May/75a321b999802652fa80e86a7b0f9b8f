The Port of Port Elizabeth (PE) has become the first port in South Africa to achieve the International Organisation for Standardisation’s (ISO’s) 45001 certification, the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) said in a statement this week. ISO 45001 is an international standard that specifies requirements for an occupational health and safety (OH&S) management system, with guidance for its use to enable an organisation to proactively improve its OH&S performance in preventing injury and ill health. ISO 45001 is the new ISO standard for OH&S. It is set to considerably improve levels of workplace safety, TNPA highlighted. “The port is proud to be the first port in the TNPA port system to be ISO 45001 certified,” said Port of PE manager Rajesh Dana. “The certification reiterates the principle that safety is all of our responsibility. I not only commend the milestone that our Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE) department has achieved, but also the entire port community.” Dana added that ISO 45001 would allow the port to control all factors that might result in illness, injury and, in extreme cases, death, by mitigating adverse effects on the physical, mental and cognitive condition of its employees, stakeholders and visitors, thereby ensuring zero harm. There are many differences between the previously required Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series 18001 and ISO 45001; however, the TNPA noted the main change as the interaction between the organisation and its business environment as opposed to OH&S hazards and other internal issues.
