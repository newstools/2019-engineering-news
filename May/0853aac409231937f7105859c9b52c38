Following what he calls “non-partisan feedback” Gauteng Premier David Makhura on Friday returned Panyaza Lesufi to the province’s Education portfolio as Education and Youth Development MEC. On Wednesday, Makhura had announced that Lesufi would lead the Finance and e-Government portfolio, but following criticism around the move, Makhura said he had given serious consideration to the issue. Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko will take over the Finance and e-Government portfolio. “While there is an appreciation of the appointment of MEC Lesufi to the Finance and e-Government portfolio, the overall non-partisan feedback from society, the education sector and the movement in general is that it will serve Gauteng better that he remains in the Education portfolio to continue the good work of ensuring that our province is the leader and pioneer of educational transformation,” said Makhura. He added that feedback on his new executive was largely profoundly positive and said his new team combined experience with youthful energy, talent, better education and fresh ideas. President Cyril Ramaphosa had been questioned regarding the moving of Lesufi by 70 schoolgirls who had spent their Thursday at the Union Buildings as part of the Cell C Take a Girl Child to Work Day programme. Newly sworn in Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga also said that she believed moving Lesufi from education was a big mistake. However, Makhura defended his decision to appoint each MEC to a specific portfolio and said it was not made lightly. “As I stated, the team of ten MECs I have appointed have diverse set of skills, vast experience and talents that enable them to play different roles in several portfolios. Let the team get down to work to serve the people of Gauteng,” he concluded.
