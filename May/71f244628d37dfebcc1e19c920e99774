Brazilian companies are expected to generate business of $5.3-million over the next year as a result of the recent African Utility Week and PowerGEN Africa conference and exhibition. The Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency, Apex-Brasil, in partnership with the Brazilian Association of the Electrical and Electronics Industry, called Abinee, said business of $880 000 alone was generated through the event, which was held in Cape Town from May 14 to 16. During the three-day event, Brazilian delegates held 312 meetings, of which 264 are new contacts, said Abinee. It added that the synergy between Abinee, Apex-Brasil and the Consulate General of Brazil in Cape Town had led to a great deal of networking through meetings and seminars. The Consul-General of Brazil in Cape Town, Carmen Ribeiro Moura, also took part in events during the week. The Electro-Electronic Brasil programme – the outcome of an agreement between Abinee and Apex-Brasil – promotes foreign trade in the electric and electronic sectors. In addition to meeting with companies from South Africa, contacts were also made with companies from the US, Namibia, Tanzania, Mozambique, Botswana, Angola, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, India and Lebanon, Abinee said. “We will continue to support the sector through the sector project, as it relates to export promotion and attracting foreign direct investment, with the objective of transforming the new contacts [into] realised business [opportunities]," said the foreign affairs manager of Abinee, Giselle Hipólito. Through the Electro-Electronic Brasil initiative, companies participate in trade fairs, missions, business roundtables and market studies. The programme currently has 100 participating companies from Brazil that, together, export 207 products to 134 destinations, covering the areas of industrial automation, electrical and electronic components, telecommunications, electrical installation material, industrial equipment and electronic security.
