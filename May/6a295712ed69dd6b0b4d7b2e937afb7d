NYSE-listed hospitality company Hilton has signed a management agreement with South African real estate investment trust Growthpoint Properties to open a hotel under its Canopy by Hilton brand. The 150 guestroom Canopy by Hilton Cape Town Longkloof is expected to begin welcoming guests in 2021 and will be the brand’s debut property in Africa. Canopy by Hilton was launched in 2014 to appeal to travellers seeking locally inspired stays and wishing to immerse themselves in the culture and history of local neighbourhoods. It currently operates in nine destinations around the world with more than 35 properties in the pipeline. The Canopy by Hilton Cape Town Longkloof is located near the city’s historical epicentre and will bring to life the heritage of a 112-year-old site, Longkloof Studios. The project forms part of a precinct redevelopment by Growthpoint, representing a R550-million investment in the city. DHK architects will redevelop a building which began life as the premises of what was then the United Tobacco Company and subsequently served as the home of Cape Town’s Women’s Institute. “Growthpoint is thrilled to partner with Canopy by Hilton to launch this phenomenal brand in Africa,” commented Growthpoint chief development and investment officer Rudolf Pienaar. “Our prime Longkloof redevelopment project is in a magnificent multifaceted historic urban quarter of Cape Town and is the perfect setting for the first Canopy by Hilton branded property on the continent. Our investment in this property reflects our confidence in Cape Town, as well as Hilton’s exceptional upscale lifestyle hotel brand.” Hilton Europe, Middle East and Africa development senior VP Patrick Fitzgibbon indicated that Canopy by Hilton becomes the company’s third brand to gain a presence in Cape Town and that the company is eyeing further expansion.
