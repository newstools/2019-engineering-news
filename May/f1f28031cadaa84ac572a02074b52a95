Gautrain has introduced various changes to its train schedule from this month to provide a “more convenient and comfortable service” to passengers. The afternoon peak period has been extended northbound only, from Park station to Hatfield station, from Monday to Friday. The afternoon peak now starts at 14:38, compared with 15:28 previously. While trains will be available every ten minutes from 14:38, off-peak fares will apply during this extended period. Trains travelling southbound, from Hatfield station to Park station, will depart earlier on weekdays. The first train departure times are: -Hatfield at 05:05 -Pretoria at 05:12 -Centurion at 05:20 -Midrand at 05:29 -Marlboro at 05:35 -Sandton at 05:40 -Rosebank at 05:44 Gautrain has also introduced additional eight-car trains during the morning and afternoon peak periods on the north-to-south line. The first train departing from OR Tambo at 05:19 travelling towards Sandton now stops at Rhodesfield and Marlboro stations. As such, both Rhodesfield and Marlboro stations now have an earlier train departure on weekdays, starting at 05:22 and 05:29, respectively. On weekends and public holidays, trains are now available every 20 minutes between OR Tambo and the Sandton station as opposed to every 30 minutes. In addition to the schedule enhancements, the high peak fare (red fare) has been suspended for a trial period but may, depending on capacity constraints, be reintroduced at a later stage.
