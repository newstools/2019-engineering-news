Two learners from Star College High in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, were announced as the winners of the twentieth national South African Youth Water Prize (SAYWP) competition. Their Hydro-Conservation innovation, is aimed at reducing the quantity of water that is wasted in households across South Africa daily during showering and handwashing. The SAYWP is a science and technology based project and is coordinated by the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS). The learners – Kiara Chetty and Calden Gounden – will represent South Africa at the Annual Stockholm Junior Youth Water Prize event in Stockholm, Sweden at the end of August. They will compete against learners from 30 other countries around the world for the prize. In a statement last week, DWS water services and local water management chief director Rex Mtileni said the competition was a means of investing in young people so that they would pursue careers in the water and sanitation sector.
