The Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA), in conjunction with the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority, is planning a shutdown of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) water transfer and delivery tunnel and associated systems during October and November. The shutdown will allow the two entities to effectively perform maintenance work that will ensure the conveyance system continues to operate optimally. During this period, no water would be transferred from the LHWP to the Vaal river system and the Ash and Liebenbergsvlei rivers could potentially come to a standstill, the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) warned on Wednesday. Municipalities in Mafube, Nketoana and Dihlabeng will be affected and the DWS has confirmed that contingency plans are in place for the shutdown period. Farmers along the river will also be notified so that over-abstraction does not occur during the shutdown period, which might also affect the planting season. Moreover, the DWS further advised that water provision would not be adversely affected by the shutdown, as it would closely monitor the use and flow of water in the affected rivers during the shutdown period. Patrons are requested to use water sparingly.
