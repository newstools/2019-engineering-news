State-owned Air Traffic and Navigation Services (ATNS) has appointed Lulekwa Ngcwabe as its new human resources executive. She joins ATNS from the City of Johannesburg’s Metrobus entity, where she was GM for corporate services. ATNS’s philosophy is to create shared accountability for development and learning for its employees, says interim CEO Thomas Kgokolo. He explains that the intention is to afford all staff opportunities to learn and develop, either within their immediate sphere or beyond the simplest daily job routine. “This inevitably means that our company is depending on its employees to identify, create and make use of available opportunities to develop themselves beyond traditional work-based training, as retention of staff is key. This is one of Ngcwabe’s mandates – to entrench this philosophy within ATNS. “The face of our executive committee is changing. The appointment of experts and thought leaders in leadership positions in this company, especially women, is no coincidence. It has become the norm,” concludes Kgokolo.
