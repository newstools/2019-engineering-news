Africa’s first solar-powered seawater desalination plant, the OSMOSUN plant, designed by Mascara and located in Witsand, in the Hessequa municipality, in the Western Cape, has produced more than 10  000 kℓ of drinkable water. The plant has been fully operational since December 20, 2018, providing the local population with a steady water supply, especially over the Christmas period. “It is an outstanding achievement that within just two months of operation the desalination plant is already surpassing 10 000 kℓ of drinkable water,” enthused Wesgro CEO Tim Harris. “The installation further endorses that Cape Town and the Western Cape has successfully emerged as a water resilient destination and a world leader in sustainability. A resilient destination is even more attractive to tourists and investors alike and, therefore, a key component of our economic promotion of the destination now and into the future.” The project, co-funded by the French Treasury and the Province of the Western Cape, was developed and completed in less than 18 months by Turnkey Water Solutions (TWS ) and Mascara Renewable Water, together with a strong team of local consultants and contractors. The plant is currently producing an average of 150 kℓ of drinkable water a day. The municipal staff have been trained and are fully empowered to operate the plant’s day-to-day activities. The plant is remotely controlled by TWS, together with Mascara Renewable Water, and is continuously monitored to ensure perfect integration into its environment. All data is made public on the municipal website for full transparency.
