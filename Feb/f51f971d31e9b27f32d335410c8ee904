Anadarko Petroleum Corp wants a fleet of at least six vehicles with armor heavy enough to stop AK-47 bullets at its natural-gas project in Mozambique. And it needs them soon. The company called for expressions of interest from potential suppliers of so-called B6 specification vehicles, and also wants associated fleet management services, according to an advertisement published in the Maputo-based Noticias newspaper on Thursday. Anadarko is expected to spend at least $20-billion on its project in Palma, near the Tanzanian border, where a shadowy insurgency has killed more than 100 people and destroyed hundreds of homes. The attacks reached an area a few kilometers from the company’s worker camp this month, according to local media reports. “In order to ensure readiness for operations, there is an immediate need” for the vehicles, Anadarko said in the advertisement. Other oil and gas operators including Eni and Exxon Mobil also have projects in Palma. Anadarko plans to reach a final investment decision on its Mozambique LNG project this year, and has already started a community resettlement project. “We take the security and safety of our people very seriously, and for that reason, we do not discuss specific security measures,” the company said in response to emailed questions.
