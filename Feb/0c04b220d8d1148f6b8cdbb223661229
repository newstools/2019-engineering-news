South Africa's struggling power firm Eskom has agreed a R15-billion loan facility with a consortium of local and international banks, it said on Friday, an important step as it tries to close a funding gap before the end of March. Eskom is vital to the health of Africa's most industrialised economy as it supplies more than 90% of its power, but it is drowning in around R420-billion of debt after a decade of steep financial decline. "The government-guaranteed facility will form part of the financing of Eskom's current capital expenditure programme," Eskom said in a statement.
