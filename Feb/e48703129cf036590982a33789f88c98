Mobile data-only network operator Rain is preparing for a mid-2019 commercial launch of South Africa’s first fifth-generation (5G) network. In partnership with global information and communications technology (ICT) solutions provider Huawei, Rain has built the first 5G commercial network, with testing taking place on the already-live network. In the first phase of roll-out, Rain has deployed a number of 5G sites in key areas in Johannesburg, said Rain CEO William Roos, who made the announcement at the Mobile World Congress, in Spain, earlier this week. The network is using Huawei's end-to-end 5G solutions and Rain’s 3.6 GHz spectrum to deliver fibre-like speeds without the installation complexities, time delays and costs of laying fibre in under-serviced areas. “Apart from deploying new base stations, Huawei’s solutions enable Rain to fully leverage its existing long-term evolution network and allocated spectrum for 5G deployment. This approach of sharing facilities and leveraging existing infrastructure will enable Rain to roll out the 5G network in a quick, cost-effective manner,” Roos noted. Rain aims to expand the 5G network to cover all major metropolitan areas to provide ultra-broadband services to homes and enterprises.
