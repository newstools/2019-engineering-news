Paper and packaging company Mondi said on Friday it expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for the year ended December 31 to be above that of the comparable prior year period of €1.48-billion. Mondi, which will release its results on February 28, said special item net charges after tax for the year would be around €92-million, of which €81-million was recognised in the first half. The group recognised special item net charges after tax of €53-million the previous year. Accordingly, Mondi said its basic headline earnings per share would likely range between €1.82 and €1.88, an increase of 25% to 29% from 2017.
