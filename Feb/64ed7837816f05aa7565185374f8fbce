JSE-listed Group Five has appointed nonexecutive director Dr Thabo Kgogo interim CEO effective February 1, following Solomon Themba Mosai’s resignation, which was effective January 31. Mosai was employed by Group Five for 15 years. He was appointed interim CEO in March 2018 and as CEO in May 2018. Group Five has started a search for a new CEO, but, in the meantime, believes that Kgogo’s wealth of experience in capital projects implementation will aid the company in its ongoing restructuring and resizing, to focus on developments, investments and concessions. Christina Teixeira stepped down as the group’s CFO in December.
