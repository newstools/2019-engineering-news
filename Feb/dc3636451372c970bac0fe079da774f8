Integrated alternative and renewable energy business Renergen’s Tetra4 subsidiary has secured an agreement with fuel products distributor Black Knight Group for the sale of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Black Knight has, in recent years, developed a logistics division to provide holistic fuel solutions for its clients. The acquired LNG is intended to fuel about 100 trucks. Black Knight oil CEO Jacques D’ymant says the use of alternative fuels by suppliers continues to take centre stage, thereby providing cleaner and safer solutions for businesses and the environment. “Through our partnership with Tetra4, we can now ensure that these ongoing benefits, including cost savings, are passed on to our clients.” Renergen CEO Stefano Marani says Tetra4 is “proud to be associated with Black Knight as they embark on their new venture to disrupt the local logistics market using cutting-edge technology and international best practice”. Tetra4 is a vertically integrated gas producer that holds the only onshore petroleum production licence in South Africa.
