The current term of the board started on December 1, 2015, and ended on November 30, 2018. One extension had already been granted to February 28. The latest extension is to allow the Department of Water and Sanitation and the Minister time to apply their minds to the consideration of the candidates for the new board that have been submitted to the Minister. The TCTA board will remain constituted of chairperson Zodwa Manase, CEO Percy Sechemane, Dr Michael Ellman, Satish Roopa, Simphiwe Kondlo, Sijabulile Mkhathini, Tshepiso Moahloli and Muziwandile Chonco.
