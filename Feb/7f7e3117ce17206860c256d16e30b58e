Power utility Eskom on Monday said Stage 2 load-shedding would start at 09:00 and would likely continue until 22:00.
 
"Although a number of generating units have returned to service as per the nine-point recovery plan, regrettably additional units continue to trip. This results in a shortage of generating capacity," it said in a release.
 
Eskom resumed load-shedding at the weekend, the first time it has needed to implement the rotational cuts since the start of the December holidays.
