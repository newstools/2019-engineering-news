The South African government's plan to split struggling state power company Eskom into three entities does little to address the company's financial difficulties, credit ratings agency Moody's said in a research report. "The move paves the way for a more transparent group with more clearly allocated revenue and cost between business segments," Moody's said, adding that Eskom remained a significant risk to the country's fiscal strength. "However, in and of itself it does little to address Eskom's financial challenges," Moody's said.
