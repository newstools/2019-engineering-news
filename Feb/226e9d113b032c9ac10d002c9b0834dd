The South African National Biodiversity Institute (Sanbi) has provided the Western Cape Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning with R4.1-million in funding to help combat the illegal clearing of indigenous vegetation in the Cape Winelands district. The illegal clearing threatens the farming and ecosystem functioning of the area. The funding was for an initial 30-month period. Western Cape Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning Minister Anton Bredell welcomed Sanbi’s support and said indigenous vegetation had been under serious threat in some areas of the province, owing to illegal clearing. Alleged offenders who conduct such activities are liable to be issued with a compliance notice or arrested in serious cases. Failure to comply with a compliance notice is a criminal offence and fines of up to R5-million or five years’ imprisonment may be imposed. “The unique indigenous vegetation in this area provides a number of economic opportunities and sustainable livelihood for locals and business. However, illegal clearing of indigenous vegetation, over-consumption of water and pollution severely compromise the ecosystem,” commented botanist Phil McLean. The Cape Winelands district is situated within two globally recognised biodiversity hotpots – the Cape Floristic region, which is home to more than 9 000 plant species, and the Succulent Karoo.
