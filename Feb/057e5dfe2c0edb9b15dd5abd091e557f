Imperial Logistics is finalising its results for the six-month period to December 31, 2018, and expects revenue and operating profit to be in line with its guidance as announced in October 2018. Basic earnings a share for the period, which included the now unbundled Motus Holdings, are expected to increase by more than 20% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the profit realised from the unbundling of Motus. Headline earnings a share are also expected to increase, mainly as a result of lower debt levels resulting in lower interest costs, as well as reduced costs relating to the amortisation of intangible assets. Imperial will release its interim results on February 28.
