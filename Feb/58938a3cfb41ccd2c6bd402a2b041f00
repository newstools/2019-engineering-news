South African petrochemicals group Sasol on Monday reported an 18% jump in half-year profit on the back of higher crude oil prices, a weaker rand to the dollar and higher margins in its speciality chemicals unit. Core headline earnings per share (HEPS) rose to R21.45 ($1.54) for the six months ended December 31, 2018 from R18.22 in the same period a year earlier. HEPS is the primary profit gauge in South Africa and strips out certain one-off items.
