Local chemicals and energy company Sasol on Wednesday announced that its new linear low-density polyethylene unit, in Lake Charles, in the US, officially achieved beneficial operations on February 13. This is the first of the seven Lake Charles chemicals project (LCCP) production units to come on line. The milestone follows the safe and successful commissioning of the steam system, which produced first steam on August 1, 2018, a few weeks earlier than planned, Sasol said. All utilities to support the early process units at LCCP were fully operational by the end of November 2018.
