Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has appointed a panel to interview and recommend a shortlist of potential candidates for the position of the Commissioner of the South African Revenue Service (Sars). The President appoints the Sars Commissioner, but the Finance Minister is responsible for overseeing the initial steps of the appointment process. Mboweni will submit the panel’s recommendations to the President for his consideration. The panel comprises former Finance Minister Trevor Manuel as chairperson, independent consultant Angela Bester; Justice Dennis Davis;  Eskom board member and chartered accountant Sindi Mabaso-Koyana; National Treasury deputy director-general Ismail Momoniat; Advocate Thandi Orleyn; and Nampak human resources director Fezekile Tshiqi. The process for the appointment of Sars Commissioner takes into account the recommendations made by the Commission of Inquiry into Tax Administration and Governance by the SARS, which was chaired by Judge Robert Nugent. The commission recommended the appointment of persons to a selection panel who “…should be apolitical and not answerable to any constituency, and should be persons of high standing who are able to inspire confidence across the taxpaying spectrum”. The commission had also proposed criteria against which shortlisted candidates should be evaluated for suitability. The panel has already started its work and is expected to complete its process in the next few weeks. Mark Kingon was appointed acting Sars Commissioner, after former Commissioner Tom Moyane was fired in November 2018.
