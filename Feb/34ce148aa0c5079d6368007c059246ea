JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Mining and marketing company Assore on Tuesday reported 20% higher headline earnings to R2.92-billion in the six months to December 31, buoyed by an improved price basket and weaker exchange rate countering inland logistics difficulties on certain product lines. Assore's jointly controlled Assmang recorded headline earnings of R4.29-billion, an increase of 23% on a 100% basis, which made a R2.14-billion headline earnings contribution. Assmang which mines both iron and manganese ore in the Northern Cape, has manganese smelting facilities at Cato Ridge in KwaZulu-Natal and holds 54.36% of Sakura Ferroalloys, a manganese smelter in Malaysia. Assore owns 100% of Dwarsrivier underground chrome mine in Limpopo, which contributed R327-million to group operational earnings. Following the 60% increase in the interim dividend last year, the interim dividend has been held at R10 a share to build reserves for future growth ambitions. Manganese ore prices were higher for both 44% and 37% manganese grades and sales of iron-ore and chrome ore were lower on unforeseen inland logistical challenges, while sales volumes for manganese ore and alloys were higher. The index price achieved for iron-ore was stable while the lump premium increased. Increases in demand out of China for high quality ores continued to play out well for Assore’s quality product portfolio, said Assore CEO Charles Walters. However, a declining trend in steel prices and reduced steel mill profitability in China, seen towards the end of the period, is anticipated to result in a swing back to ore with a lower iron content, leading to a narrowing of price differentials between the various grades of ore available in the market, he added.
