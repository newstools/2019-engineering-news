Europe-based global aerospace major group Airbus announced on Thursday that production of its flagship four-engined A380 Superjumbo airliner would end in 2021. This is because the main customer for the aircraft, Emirates, had decided to cut its order for the airliner by 39 units, and because there is no order backlog for the type from other airlines. Instead, Emirates has ordered more twin-engined widebody A330 and A350 airliners from Airbus. The airline will take 40 new engine option (neo) A330-900s and 30 new generation A350-900s (which are largely constructed from composites). Emirates still have 14 A380s on order, which will be delivered over the next two years, and which will take the airline’s total A380 fleet to 123 aircraft. “The A380 is Emirates’ flagship and has contributed to the airline’s success for more than ten years,” highlighted Airbus Commercial Aircraft president and future Airbus group CEO Guillaume Faury. “As much as we regret the airline’s position, selecting the the A330neo and A350 for its future growth is a great endorsement of our very competitive widebody aircraft family. Going forward, we are fully committed to deliver on the longstanding confidence Emirates is placing in Airbus.” “The consequences of this decision are largely embedded in our 2018 full year results,” said current Airbus group CEO Tom Enders. “The A380 is not only an outstanding engineering and industrial achievement. Passengers all over the world love to fly on this great aircraft. Hence today’s announcement is painful for us and the A380 communities worldwide. But, keep in mind that A380s will still roam the skies for many years to come and Airbus will of course continue to fully support the A380 operators.” Emirates made its decision after reviewing its operations and considering the advances in aircraft and engine technologies. In the next few weeks Airbus will start talks with its “social partners” regarding the 3 000 to 3 500 jobs that could be affected by this decision. However, given the continuing ramp-up of production of the A320 single-aisle airliner family, it is likely that many of the A380 workers could be transferred to the A320 programme.
