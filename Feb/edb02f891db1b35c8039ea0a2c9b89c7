The national budget allocates R1.8-billion for 262 priority land reform projects over the next three years, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni announced on Wednesday. A further R3.7-billion will go to emerging farmers seeking to acquire land. Mboweni said the Land Bank would support smallholding farmers and leverage partnerships with other financial institutions. "It aims to disburse R3-billion in the next financial year." The allocations come as lawmakers are starting to draft an amendment to the constitution to explicitly allow for the expropriation of land without compensation.
