From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: Linhleko Projects officially launched its cooperation agreement with FLSmidth this month, in which the 50/50 profit sharing agreement allows Linhleko to use FLSmidth’s REFLUX Classifier technology to enhance chrome recovery from Sibanye-Stillwater’s Waterval operation. Nadine James tells us more. Nadine James: The agreement resulted as part of FLSmidth’s enterprise development programme, and consequently enabled the Sibanye agreement, in which Linhleko will build, own, operate and eventually transfer a RC modular plant that will produce chromite concentrate by processing material from Waterval’s waste dumps. Minerals Resources Deputy Minster Godfrey Olifant explains how and why this agreement is so laudable. Minerals Resources Deputy Minster Godfrey Olifant: Nadine James: FLSmidth project manager Kelly Rule explains how the technology works. FLSmidth project manager Kelly Rule: Nadine James: At the event Sibanye-Stillwater chrome senior VP David Kovarsky stated the RC technology will enable Sibanye to recover more chrome and increase concentrate production by 20%. Linhleko Group CEO Buang Moloto enthused that the agreement represented the redefining of black excellence in the mining sector, in which multinationals recognised and endorsed the expertise and capabilities of a Rustenburg-based black-owned company.
