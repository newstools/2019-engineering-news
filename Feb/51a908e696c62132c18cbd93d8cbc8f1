The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) will be closing the M2 motorway between the Crown interchange and Martizburg street to allow for bridge rehabilitation to resume. The road closure will be in effect from 06:00 on February 28 until the end of October. This follows after Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba raised concerns about the stability of the Kaserne and Selby sections of the M2 bridge, which poses a danger to road users as a result of required maintenance repairs.
