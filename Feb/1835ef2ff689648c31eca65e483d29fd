A dispute over JSE-listed Jasco Electronics' majority ownership of Reflex Solutions by the fairly new additionâ€™s minority shareholders is heading for arbitration. Jasco in November warned shareholders in its 2018 annual financial statements that the minority shareholders of Reflex Solutions have raised a legal dispute with Jasco regarding the majority ownership of the company. Jasco acquired a 51% share in the Johannesburg-based information technology managed services group for R39.8-million in November 2017. The jointly agreed arbitration has been set down for mid-March. Further updates will follow on conclusion of the arbitration process.
