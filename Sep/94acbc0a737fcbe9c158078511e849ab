Former South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa) director CEO Phumulani Zwane has raised concern that a number of pertinent aspects were not included in an earlier article. On August 12, Engineering News Online published an article, based on a release issued by the Companies and Intellectual Properties Commission (see the article below). Zwane argues that the release omitted information set out in the Gauteng High Court's judgment. The original High Court judgment is attached for readers' reference. Zwane on September 2 submitted an application for leave to appeal the August ruling by the Gauteng High Court.
