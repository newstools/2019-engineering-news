Environmental organisation Greenpeace Africa says the country cannot be given a “so-called choice between load-shedding or toxic air and impending death” when cheap clean energy options exist. In response to comments made by power utility Eskom COO Jan Oberholzer on Wednesday that blackouts might be an outcome of the utility complying with air quality legislation, Greenpeace says Eskom must either comply with the legislation or close its coal-fired power stations more quickly than planned. “Eskom’s COO is in one breath admitting that the utility is not doing what it needs to do to meet weak air quality standards and protect human life, and in the next, blackmailing us all with more load-shedding should Eskom actually take steps to comply,” says Greenpeace Africa senior climate and energy campaign manager Melita Steele. She notes that renewable energy is more than able to quickly fill the gap; however, emphasises that a quick response is imperative. She adds that the country must begin to urgently scale up investments in renewable energy and finalise social plans for the closure of the coal-fired power stations as part of the just transition.
