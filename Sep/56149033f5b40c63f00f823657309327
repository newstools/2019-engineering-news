The George Integrated Public Transport Network (GIPTN), better known as Go George, reached a milestone this month when MAN Truck & Bus handed over 18 new buses to George Link, the vehicle operating company providing transport services to Go George. Part of the implementation of the GIPTN project is aimed at ensuring the establishment by former taxi operators of a company that goes on to deliver various types of public transport services in George. The contractual agreement is that the initial bus fleet will be acquired by the George municipality and leased to George Link, and that any additional buses needed after three years from rolling out the bus service, will be acquired by the operating company. George Link director and operational manager John Heathcote said this was a momentous occasion for all shareholders. “We are very emotional about this milestone, especially if you consider where we’ve come from and where we stand today,” he commented in a statement issued on Monday. Heathcote said it was an “exceptional” experience working with MAN to customise the company’s buses. “We eventually felt ashamed to go back to them with yet another request of something we’d like to see on our buses, but they simply complied with our wish list and government’s specifications; it was a process of open negotiations and mutual respect. “MAN’s commitment and fervour to do business is further demonstrated by the new branch they’ve opened in George, where maintenance on the buses will be undertaken.” Go George manager James Robb congratulated George Link on the acquisition of its own buses. “Go George is a transformation project and to see George Link taking ownership of their own bus fleet is seeing those who had been part of the taxi industry in George, being further empowered as the project was aimed to do."
