The South African Revenue Service (Sars) has warned that a strike in the banking sector, planned for Friday 27 September, may cause disruption. The Congress of South African Trade Unions-affiliated South African Society of Bank Officials (Sasbo), the biggest union in the financial sector, is calling for a moratorium on job losses in the banking sector. Apart from a strike, its members plan protest action in Johannesburg. “We remain concerned about the high levels of unemployment (29%), the state of our economy, the current and future impact of the 4th Industrial Revolution, the direct and indirect societal implications, amongst others, we cannot afford for even one job to be lost,” Sasbo said in a statement about the planned strike to its members. “As a member of Sasbo, and through Sasbo’s affiliation, a member of Cosatu, your participation in this protest action is legally protected. This means that you cannot be disciplined for participating in this legally protected protest action,” it told its members. In a statement, Sars warned that the “anticipated protest action” may impact tax payment and refund transactions. Sars said that the banks have informed it of a possible strike. It encouraged taxpayers to submit their payments two business days in advance because of the planned strike.
