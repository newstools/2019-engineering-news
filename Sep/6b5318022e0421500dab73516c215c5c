The first phase of the Rustenburg Mall is set to be complete by April 2021, accommodating 120 retailers over 40 000 m2 of gross leasable area (GLA). Property managers and developers, the Moolman Group, Twin City and JB Holdings, are jointly developing the shopping centre and started bulk earthworks for the development on August 6. Moolman Group developments director Steph Beyers said in a statement this week that the mall would be a one-stop solution and bring together the current scattered retail shopping offering in the area. Rustenburg Mall will be situated near the central business district, serving more than 80 000 households in the primary trade area. Confirmed anchor tenants for the mall include Dis-Chem, Shoprite, Checkers, Game and Woolworths. Development of the mall will create 800 jobs in the construction phase, and with more than 75% of the first-phase GLA already committed for occupation by keen retailers, 1 000 permanent jobs will be created once the mall is open.
