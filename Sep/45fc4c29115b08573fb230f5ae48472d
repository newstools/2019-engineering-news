The City of Johannesburg has completed the restoration and rehabilitation of almost 20 km of Rea Vaya bus lanes. The restoration was focused on repairing all structural damages, surface defects and improving the structural strength and bearing capacity of the existing road along the Rea Vaya trunk routes to improve the safety of all road users. Commuters will enjoy the benefits of buses running smoothly on the road along Phase 1B, from Soweto (Thokoza Park to Parktown Stations) and all inner city trunk routes and stations. The improved road infrastructure is expected to greatly reduce the maintenance and running costs of buses. This will result in greater efficiency and reliability of the service for Rea Vaya commuters. This labour-intensive project engendered a positive spinoff, with local youth benefitting from temporary employment. In the Cityâ€™s Region D, 15 people were employed, constituting seven males, eight females and nine youth. Region F created employment for about 20 residents, constituting 11 males, nine females and eight youth. The project was implemented over a period of three months. There were delays owing to sporadic unrest in the areas, but the city managed to engage with citizens towards a successful completion.
