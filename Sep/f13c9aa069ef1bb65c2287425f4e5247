The University of Western Cape (UWC), in partnership with Quality Filtration Systems (QFS), has successfully designed, installed and commissioned a borehole water purification plant. The solution enables a fully automated, advanced-technology membrane water treatment plant to purify borehole water from an aquifer on the higher education institution’s campus. “We are able to make drinking water right here on campus,” says UWC infrastructure and engineering director Jairaj Ramchander. The project, in which QFS combines membrane technology with a traditional aquifer borehole, will pump 500 000 ℓ/d of drinking water that meets World Health Organisation standards into UWC’s water reticulation system. “The process makes use of blends and bypasses, reducing capital, operating expenses and cuts out the need for a stabilisation step,” says QFS MD Herman Smit, noting that the solution is SANS 241 drinking water standards compliant. QFS, which has the capability to design, install and commission seawater desalination, brackish water, mine water and wastewater treatment plants, has been installing advanced-technology water treatment plants for more than two decades, with over 40 reference projects across South Africa.
