The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) is in the process of establishing a task team aimed at tackling escalating incidents of water pollution across the country. The Anti-Pollution Task Team (APTT), through the department’s Water Quality Management unit, will be tasked with undertaking a nationwide assessment of the status of water quality throughout the value chain. “The DWS is of the opinion that the task team will strengthen the compliance monitoring and enforcement functions to ensure all water users comply with standards as set out in the National Water Act and Regulations,” the department said in a statement on Thursday. Driven by Deputy Minister David Mahlobo, following his July policy and budget policy statement, the team will work to prevent pollution from the source to obviate the potential of tap water being polluted. This will strengthen the protection of the environment and water resources, as well as improve services. The Water Sector Regulation, under the chief directorate for Water Quality Management, is responsible for the conceptualisation and process towards the formation of the APTT. It is envisaged that the process will be signed off by Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu and Mahlobo once this process is completed. Various parts of the country are being flagged for contamination of water courses, including rivers.
