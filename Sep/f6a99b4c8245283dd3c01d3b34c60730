Radisson Hotel Group will open its first Radisson Red hotel in Johannesburg in February 2021. The hotel will be located in Oxford Parks, a mixed-use precinct comprising offices, apartments and supporting retail and restaurants, in Rosebank. The 222-room hotel will comprise standard studios and suites and will feature Radisson Red food and beverage concepts and social scenes, such as the "all day dining" Oui Bar & Ktchn. It will also have a rooftop bar and terrace, along with a swimming pool and fitness room. The hotel will offer six event studios, a conference room and a large meeting room, each with high-speed WiFi, up-to-date technology and creative spaces. This will be the hotel group's second Radisson Red hotel in South Africa and will bring the group's African portfolio to nearly 100 hotels in operation and under development. “We are excited to have signed our second Radisson Red in South Africa and introduce our third brand to Johannesburg, alongside Radisson Blu and Park Inn by Radisson. Following our successful opening of Africa’s first Radisson Red in Cape Town, bringing this next generation Red to Johannesburg will support the roll-out of future Red’s across South Africa and the region. "Rosebank is one of the fastest growing business precincts in Johannesburg and is regarded as the city’s art district, making it the ideal location for our upscale, lifestyle select-service hotel brand, which presents a playful twist on the conventional. The hotel will be the first internationally branded lifestyle hotel in Johannesburg and our fourth hotel in the city,” says Radisson Hotel Group sub-Saharan Africa development senior VP Andrew McLachlan. Oxford Parks representative Thinus Crafford points out that the Radisson Red will form part of the first phase of the mixed-use development.
