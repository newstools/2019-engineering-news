George municipality on Thursday confirmed that the raising of the Garden Route dam spillway and wall was on track for completion by March next year. The project started in May and the municipality reported that concrete for the first two sections of the spillway footing had been placed. “The raising of the dam wall was progressing steadily with about 10 000 m3 of suitable fill material extracted from the dam basin on the MTO Forestry/ Nelson Mandela University side of the dam having been placed. The contractor should reach the final embankment wall height within the next two weeks, after which the ‘rip-rap’ layer will be placed. “The final curtain grouting operation will start two weeks after the wall footings have been cast. Most of the wall footing ground anchors have been grouted in, with only the stilling basin anchors to be placed after completion of the wall footings. “About 54 t of reinforcement will be used in the spillway footings alone,” the municipality stated.
