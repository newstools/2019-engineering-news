Rand Water on Thursday said its main treatment plants had not been pumping any water because a veld fire affected an electricity sub-station that supplies power to the plants. "As a result of a veld fire, the 88kV power supply from Eskom’s Snowden Sub-station was impacted last night, Wednesday, 18 September 2019 affecting power supply to both of Rand Water’s Zuikerbosch Plant and its Lethabo Pumping Stations," said Justice Mohale, Rand Water's Media Relations Manager. Mohale said as a result of the power interruption both of Rand Water’s main treatment plants were not pumping any water. "This has affected a number of our reservoir levels, the impact of which extends to today and possibly subsequent days. The situation is made worse by higher temperatures resulting in increased water demands," said Mohale. "Rand Water thanks Eskom for having restored power supply, and the fire fighters for extinguishing the fire. Our contribution as consumers is that we continue to use water sparingly to allow the reservoirs to recover. "In the event that water demands do not improve Rand Water will have no alternative but to restrict in order to assist the situation."
