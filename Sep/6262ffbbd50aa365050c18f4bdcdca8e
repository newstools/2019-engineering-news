Rand Water on Friday said it has formally notified three of its municipal customers of its intention to reduce water pressure due to their non-payment for services rendered. "The water pressure to the Emfuleni Local municipality in Gauteng will be reduced by 20%. The municipality includes areas such as Vereeniging, Vanderbijlpark, Evaton, Sebokeng and Sharpeville," said Justice Mohale, the Rand Water media relations manager. He said the arrears amount due from the Emfuleni Local municipality stood at R423-million. "Two municipalities in Mpumalanga, namely the Victor Khanye and the Govan Mbeki Local Municipalities will also be subjected to these credit control measures," said Mohale. "Water pressure to the Govan Mbeki Local municipality will be reduced by a further 20% to 40%." The municipality includes areas such as Bethal, Embalenhle, Leandra and Kinross. Govan Mbeki Local municipality owes R179-million. Mohale said water pressure to the Victor Khanye municipality, which includes areas such Delmas, Botleng, Eloff and Sundra, has already been reduced to 40%. Victor Khanye Local municipality owes about R111-million in unpaid bills. "In all three of these matters, the Municipalities have failed to honour signed agreements made to settle the outstanding amounts due to Rand Water," said Mohale. "Rand Water will now implement these credit control measures to compel the municipalities to meet their obligations to the settle amounts due for water services rendered. "The provincial departments of co-operative governance and traditional affairs in Gauteng and Mpumalanga have been informed of Rand Waterâ€™s intended action." Mohale warned that if the affected municipalities fail to settle their arrears in the next few days, Rand Water will implement the credit control measures next week on Tuesday.
