Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) will buy two new workboats by 2022 to boost marine operations at the Port of Cape Town. The more powerful workboats are expected to improve the port’s ability to maintain marine operations during challenging weather conditions. The engines of the new workboats will be about 20% more powerful than the two workboats currently in operation at the port and the bollard pull will be 80% greater as a result of advanced propeller and rudder designs. The Port of Cape Town’s two existing workboats, the Kestrel and the Blue Jay, have suffered breakdowns and technical problems of late owing to their advanced age. “We’ve now concluded the 12-month-long procurement process and are in the process of awarding the R85-million contract for the building of the two workboats to the successful bidder with an anticipated delivery date of 2022,” says Cape Town port manager Mpumi Dweba-Kwetana. “This is part of the port’s craft replacement strategy through which we are responding to industry calls for a more reliable and efficient fleet of marine craft. Acquiring these new workboats will help to reduce vessel service delays and the overall efficiency and competitiveness of our port.” Meanwhile, a request has also been made to bring forward the replacement of two tugs and their launches to 2019/20 instead of 2020/21 to meet industry needs. The port will also be introducing a helicopter service in 2021 to transfer marine pilots onto and off visiting vessels, with the traditional method of using pilot boats having become ill-suited to Cape Town’s more frequent weather-related disruptions and high swell conditions.
