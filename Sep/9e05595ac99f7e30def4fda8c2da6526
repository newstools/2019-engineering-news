The Competition Commission has referred a case of alleged collusion against 18 fire protection companies to the Competition Tribunal. The companies allegedly implicated are Automatic Sprinkler Inspection Bureau (ASIB), Belfa Solutions, Bhubesi Fire Projects, Centa KZN Sprinklers, National Security, Country Contracts, Cross Fire Management, Fire Check, Fire King, Fireco, IBR Fire Protection, Jasco Fire Solutions, Multi-Net Systems, Specifire, Sylvester Fire & Piping Services, TFMC, Tshwane Fire Sprinklers and Whip Fire Projects. These companies allegedly reached an agreement in 1995 in terms of which ASIB would exclusively render fire sprinkler inspection services, while the rest of the companies would exclusively provide fire sprinkler installation services. According to the commission, the companies further agreed that each company would provide their services only in the provinces where they are based. The commission has asked the tribunal to impose an administrative penalty of 10% of each firmâ€™s annual turnover.
