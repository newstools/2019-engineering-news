The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) says it will publish the information memorandum on the licensing process for high-demand spectrum before December 31. The information memorandum will outline the authority’s approach to the licensing of the spectrum, following the publication of the Policy on High Demand Spectrum and Policy Direction on the Licensing of a Wireless Open Access Network by the Communications and Digital Technologies Minister. The information memorandum is also intended to provide guidance to stakeholders and prospective applicants on the process and criteria to be applied by the authority in the licensing of the spectrum. “Through the publication of the information memorandum, the authority further provides an opportunity to stakeholders and prospective applicants alike to make inputs and representations on the proposed licensing process, associated criteria and timelines”, says Icasa acting chairperson Dr Keabetswe Modimoeng. “The licensing of high-demand spectrum is one of the critical components to facilitate deployment of digital infrastructure to ensure that all South Africans realise and participate meaningfully in the opportunities emanating from the Fourth Industrial Revolution,” Modimoeng adds.
