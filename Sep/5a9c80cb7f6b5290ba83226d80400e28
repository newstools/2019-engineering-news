Mobile data-only network operator Rain on Wednesday said it had activated Africa's first commercial fifth-generation (5G) network by making it available to selected existing customers. The deployment of a 5G wireless data network, in certain parts of Johannesburg and Tshwane, was one of the first in the world and would help South Africa to benefit from lower data costs and the coming Fourth Industrial Revolution, the company said. "Selected customers in Rain's 5G coverage area have been invited to be the first to buy ultrafast 5G, unlimited Internet for only R1 000 a month. Rain will deliver a state-of-the-art 5G router to a customer's home. No installation is required, the router is simply plug-and-play and it will be connected immediately. The speed and capacity of the 5G network, together with the latest WiFi 6 technology in the router, will enable users to stream high-definition video to multiple devices simultaneously," chief marketing officer Khaya Dlanga noted. Rainâ€™s initial 5G offering is to provide fast, affordable and easy-to-install wireless connectivity to homes and businesses as an alternative to asymmetric digital subscriber line, fibre and fixed long-term evolution. In the next couple of weeks, Rain will open up the offer to all homes and small business within the coverage area of Johannesburg and Tshwane. During the course of 2020, the coverage area will be extended to other major metros in South Africa.
