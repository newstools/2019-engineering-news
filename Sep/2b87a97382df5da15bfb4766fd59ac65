The City of Johannesburg (COJ) has announced plans to revamp the Rea Vaya bus depot. In a statement on Tuesday, COJ said the Johannesburg Development Agency (JDA), on behalf of the city's department of transport, will be revamping the existing Selby bus depot. The aim of the revamp which is set to open in 2020 in the inner city, is to turn it into a "state-of-the-art" Rea Vaya Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) depot for phase 1B and phase 1C operations. COJ said the construction of the Selby depot is being undertaken in phases, namely phase 1, phase 2B and phase 2C. "This centrally located depot will minimise dead mileage, as well as minimise the time lost by buses in traffic congestion between depots and route starting points," Member of Mayoral Committee (MMC) for Transport Councillor Nonhlanhla Makhuba said. "This facility is a testament to the city’s medium-term focus to improving the existing bulk infrastructure to support increased development, improve public environments and social facilities, as well as linkages to the public transport facilities." Once completed, the Selby DRP depot, which was formerly used by Putco Bus, will accommodate up to 270 buses. It will feature an administration building, maintenance building, washing and refueling bays and an Intelligent Transport System (ITS) control centre. The administration block will have an ablution facilities, a canteen, offices and staff and visitors parking. "Public transport and related infrastructure has been seen as an instrument for change," said Councillor Reuben Masango, MMC for Development Planning. "This with initiatives encouraging transit services to function at an optimum level, and help contribute to reshaping urban form and catalyse further development in the inner city and the City, as a whole."
