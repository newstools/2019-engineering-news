Digitization and automation advancements could add 1.2-million jobs in South Africa by 2030, McKinsey & Co said in a report Thursday. Technology-related gains could triple South Africa’s productivity growth, more than double growth in per-capita income and add more than a percentage point to the real gross-domestic-product growth rate over the next decade, the report said. Still, McKinsey cautioned “concerted action will be needed from businesses, government, labour organisations and educational institutions” to realise the gains.
