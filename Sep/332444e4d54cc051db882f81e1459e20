The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has called on employers in the motor industry to approach wage negotiations with “an attitude to resolving the dispute”. The union and employers have reached a deadlock and will meet again at the Motor Industries Bargaining Council on September 9. On Friday, the trade union said employer bodies, the National Employers Association of South Africa, the Retail Motor Industry Organisation and the Fuel Retailers Association, were “refusing to engage with the demands” of the trade union. The union is seeking a 12% increase in wages, as well as a review of the peace clause. According to Numsa, the wage threshold for all workers must be aligned to the Basic Conditions of Employment Act for all sectors, stating that, currently, some groups of workers, such as fuel station workers, did not receive overtime pay, yearly bonuses or transport allowances and other benefits stipulated in the Act. Employers, meanwhile, proposed a 5% a year increase in wages over a three-year wage agreement. Employers have “ignored” the demand for transportation allowances and the provision of transport for fuel station workers travelling in the dark, late at night or early mornings, the union pointed out.
