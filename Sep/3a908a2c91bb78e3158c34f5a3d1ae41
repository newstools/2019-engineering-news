Trade union Solidarity on Friday started construction on its Sol-Tech campus, in Kloofsig, Pretoria. The R300-million campus and residence development is being undertaken by Kanton – Solidarity Movement’s new property investment company – and is expected to open in January 2021. The campus is the first of a range of education and employment projects worth R4.5-billion that Solidarity plans to embark on in the next five years. The Sol-Tech campus was funded through Solidarity members donating R10 to a building fund each month. “In less than two years, we will have a campus here where young people will be equipped to stay in South Africa and to be free, safe and prosperous here,” said Solidarity COO Dr Dirk Hermann.
