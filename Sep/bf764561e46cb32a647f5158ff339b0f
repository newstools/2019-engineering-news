The South African Council of Project and Construction Management Professionals (SACPCMP) will in October launch a registration category for building inspectors, in an effort to protect the public from substandard building practices, as well as improve professionalism in the sector. The council will, this month, undertake a series of roadshows in major centres across the country to ensure building inspectors understand the registration requirements and benefits. This will be followed by the start of an online registration process. Two registration categories will be available to building inspectors – certified building inspector (CBInsp) and professional building inspector (PrBInsp). Building inspectors working in or with national, provincial or local government departments or the National Home Builders Registration Council to perform regulated inspections, are required to register, says SACPCMP Registrar Butcher Matutle. Further, building inspectors working in or with a private institutions to inspect construction to ensure compliance to specification, will also need to register. Matutle explains that the key benefits to the public will include the provision of a clear understanding of what can be expected in terms of building inspectors’ performance, as well as a reduction in risks in terms of service provision.
