The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) will on October 1 implement the Interim IncoMaputo Water Use Agreement (IIMA) which specifies a minimum cross-border flow from the Crocodile and Komati rivers of 2 600 litres a second at the Ressano Garcia gauging station, in Mozambique. This is an increase of 600 litres a second from the current minimum of 2 000 litres a second specified in the Piggs Peak agreement. In preparation for the increased release of water to Mozambique, the DWS, along with the Inkomati-Usuthu Catchment Management Agency (IUCMA) and the Komati Basin Water Authority (Kobwa), will engage water users and stakeholders on the impact of this increased flow into Mozambique in the affected catchments on September 19 at the Kobwa Hall in Malalane. During the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002, the ‘Tripartite Interim Agreement for Cooperation on the Protection and Sustainable Utilisation of the Incomati and Maputo Watercourse’ (IIMA) was signed by Mozambique, South Africa and eSwatini and is being implemented under the auspices of the Tripartite Permanent Technical Committee (TPTC). The general objective of the IIMA is to promote cooperation among the three countries to ensure the protection and sustainable use of the Incomati and Maputo watercourses. Organisations that are responsible for managing the Komati and Crocodile rivers, namely, Kobwa and the IUCMA have been instructed by the TPTC to implement the minimum flows as stipulated in IIMA.
