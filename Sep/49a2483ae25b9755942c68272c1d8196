Property developer Abland is continuing to break new ground in Centurion as it adds additional buildings to its Westend Office Park. The park will comprise six A-Grade office buildings, which will total 37 000 m² in lettable spaces. Buildings A and B are complete, while the 7 000 m2 Building C is under construction. Construction on the 6 700 m2 Building D will start in March 2020. As part of the construction of Buildings C and D, Abland is developing a coffee shop that will serve the greater office park, as well as a boardroom facility to accommodate 20 people. A shuttle service for the office park has been earmarked for implementation and will be ready for operation once building D is complete. Construction on Buildings E and F will get under way later in 2020. “Westend Office Park offers everything a corporate tenant needs, from excellent security to easy accessibility,” said Abland development manager Hendrik Van Zyl.
