The 50-year Durban Aerotropolis Master Plan is set to be unveiled at the official launch of the all-new Durban Aerotropolis Visitor Centre next week. The centre, which will feature a scale model of the aerotropolis, will be launched during a special function at the Dube TradePort Special Economic Zone (SEZ) on September 12. The event will precedes the KwaZulu-Natal International Investment Conference, on September 13, which is themed around the aerotropolis concept. The 50-year Durban Aerotropolis Master Plan has the potential to catalyse social, spatial and economic transformation, and is poised to take advantage of rapidly increasing global connectivity. The purpose-built airport city is designed to enhance urban, regional and national competitiveness through improved multimodal transport access, together with planned, coordinated, aviation-linked commercial development. In essence, the Durban Aerotropolis “will make KwaZulu-Natal more economically efficient, sustainable and attractive to investment”. The MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs Nomusa Dube-Ncube is set to deliver a keynote address at the event.
