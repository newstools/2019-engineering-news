The Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA) will, in conjunction with the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority, shut down the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) water transfer and delivery tunnel and associated systems during October and November for scheduled maintenance. The shutdown will allow for inspection and maintenance work to be undertaken to ensure the conveyance system continues to operate optimally. During this period, no water will be transferred from the LHWP to the Vaal River System. The Ash and Liebenbergsvlei rivers may thus run low and South Africa's Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) has warned municipalities in Mafube, Nketoana and Dihlabeng that they may experience low water supply. The DWS does have contingency plans in place for the shutdown period. "The department would like to advise all those that will be affected by this activity that water provision will not be adversely affected by this. The department will closely monitor the use and flow of water in the rivers mentioned during the shutdown period and patrons are requested to use water sparingly," it said in a statement on Wednesday.
