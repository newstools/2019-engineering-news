Anthony Julies is retiring as deputy director-general (DDG) of the National Treasury’s Asset and Liability Management (ALM) division. Julies has opted for early retirement following a public service career spanning almost 24 years. His retirement will be effective September 30. Tshepiso Moahloli, currently chief director for liability management within the ALM division has been appointed acting ALM DDG. National Treasury DDG Dondo Mogajane on Friday thanked Julies for his longstanding service over the years. “Julies has led the ALM division through some of the most challenging times for government debt, recapitalisations for struggling State-owned entities (SOEs) and borrowing when global conditions were at a low,” he said. The ALM division is responsible for managing government borrowing and debt. It is also responsible for managing government’s yearly funding programme in a manner that ensures prudent cash management and an optimal portfolio of debt and other fiscal obligations. The division also promotes and enforces prudent financial management of SOEs through financial analysis and oversight.
