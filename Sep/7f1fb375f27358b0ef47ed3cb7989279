From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: Toyota South Africa Motors, in collaboration with partners Altron and Vodacom Business, has deployed connectivity features and in-car Wi-Fi on all new Toyota and Lexus models from September. Natasha Odendaal tells us more. Natasha Odendaal: A joint collaboration between Toyota, Vodacom and Altron has resulted in a South Africa first – a fully integrated mobile application directly connected in real time to the manufacturer and dealer systems – and is the first worldwide to offer the convergence of Wi-Fi and connectivity features in one package across the Toyota model range. Toyota South Africa president and CEO Andrew Kirby elaborates further: Natasha Odendaal: Known as Toyota Connect, the new connectivity hub will be housed within the MyToyota App, which was initially launched in 2014. The technology allows Toyota owners access to a myriad of convenience, connectivity and safety benefits. Manager for future Toyota Kerry Roodt explains: Natasha Odendaal: Through its subsidiary, Netstar, Altron jointly designed and developed the bespoke technology platform with Toyota, which enables Internet of Things aspects such as telematics and fleet management. Vodacom is enabling seamless connectivity between these platforms and vehicle owners. The project forms a key part of Vodacom’s own IoT strategy, connecting cars to unlock a dynamic user experience, and enabling safe, efficient in-car technology, which is increasingly deemed just as important as vehicle performance.
