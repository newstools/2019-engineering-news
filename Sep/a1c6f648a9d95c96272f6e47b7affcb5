Work on the engineering and construction of remote apron stands at the OR Tambo International Airport (ORTIA) should start this year, with the R2.4-billion project scheduled for completion in 2022, says Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) acting CFO Lindani Mukhudwani. The remote apron stands will be built next to the current air traffic control complex. Mukhudwani says the remote apron stands will be built at a distance from the terminal building, and will accommodate long-stay and cargo aircraft. Other capital expenditure (capex) projects in and around South Africa’s biggest airport include R887-million to be spent in the 2020 financial year on developing the so-called western precinct.

The 8.5 ha, 180 000 m2 precinct is a mixed-use facility which will include offices, retail space and a hotel. The first phase, which will include ACSA’s new head office (which will be relocating from Bedfordview), will be completed at the end of the 2020 calendar year, says Mukhudwani. The entire precinct project is valued at R4.6-billion, and will be developed as a multiyear project. Another capex project at ORTIA is the development of the Midfield cargo development phase one, which has a budget of R2.2-billion. Development of this project, which will include warehousing and cargo-holding facilities, is, however, only set for 2023 to 2026, says Mukhudwani. “Once fully developed it will be able to accommodate two-million tons of cargo.” Mukhudwani says ACSA has a capex budget of R10-billion over the next three years, with around R4.6-billion to flow from borrowings and the remainder to be funded in-house.
