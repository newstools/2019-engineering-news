South Africa’s vehicle manufacturers and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) have reached a wage agreement, says Automotive Manufacturers Employers Association (AMEO) spokesperson Andile Dlamini. However, the heads of agreement have not yet been signed. “AMEO and Numsa have scheduled a high-level meeting for this week to finalise the heads of agreement and to offer both parties the opportunity to sign the agreement. “AMEO cannot comment on the details of the agreement until both parties have signed,” says Dlamini. Wage negotiations in the vehicle retail and component manufacturing sectors are still ongoing. South African-based vehicle manufacturers include BMW, Ford, Toyota, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Isuzu, Volkswagen and a number of truck assemblers.
