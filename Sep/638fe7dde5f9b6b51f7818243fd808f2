Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni will this year present hisÂ Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement on October 30, about a week later than is the norm. National Treasury and the chairperson of the Parliament's standing committee on finance, Joseph Maswanganyi, confirmed the date to Fin24 on Thursday. They did not say why the date had been chosen. The likely reason is that either President Cyril Ramaphosa or the minister of finance could not be in Parliament in the week prior, when the mini budget address is usually delivered. At a post-Cabinet briefing on Thursday, Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu said that while he was not aware that the mini budget's date had been moved, such a move would not be a "train smash". "It is still within the period which the finance minister must make a medium term budget policy statement," he said.
