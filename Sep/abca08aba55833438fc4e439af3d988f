Trade and Industry Minister Ebrahim Patel last week issued a notice in the Government Gazette, notifying the public and interested parties that he is considering approving an application for the expansion of the OR Tambo Special Economic Zone (SEZ) to incorporate the Tshwane automotive hub, in Silverton. Interested parties have 30 days from the date of the Gazette to comment on the planned expansion. Patel received a recommendation from the SEZ advisory board to expand the OR Tambo SEZ to incorporate the Tshwane automotive hub after the Gauteng Department of Economic Development submitted an application for the expansion. The proposed automotive hub will be developed on 162 ha in Silverton, in the eastern part of Tshwane. The hub will focus on automotive component manufacturing. According to Patel, the expansion is intended to enable the Tshwane automotive hub to develop into a world-class automotive city. The proposed hub is expected to attract automotive component manufacturing companies, in line with the objectives of the Automotive Master Plan. “The proposed automotive hub in Silverton, if approved, will contribute a substantial number of jobs and business opportunities to communities in areas such as Eersterust, Moretele View, Nellmapius and Mamelodi. The hub will also contribute towards the economy of the City of Tshwane and the Gauteng province,” Patel said.
