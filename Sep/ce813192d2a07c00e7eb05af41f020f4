Solar photovoltaic (PV) solutions provider SolarSaver says manufacturing companies such as Sheffield Manufacturing, in Durban, are increasingly turning to solar energy to supplement energy needs, go green and bring down costs. “With electricity costs rising, solar energy is a low-risk investment that yields substantial rewards, especially for high daytime energy users,” says SolarSaver representative Lance Green. The company recently completed a 130 kW grid-tied solar PV system with 330 solar panels at Sheffield’s premises. Sheffield produces a range of stainless steel goods under the Powerflow Exhausts and Citiware Holloware and Sanware brands. Green notes that Sheffield’s premises was suitable for a solar PV installation, owing to its location in an open area, with minimal high-rise buildings and trees. Additionally, the firm has a sizeable flat roof, which is ideal for setting up solar panels. SolarSaver provides a zero-capital financing model and rent-to-own, or “rent the sun”, type contracts, mean companies are able to save on installation, maintenance, monitoring and insurance costs, the solutions provider says. Green expects solar PV energy to be the fastest-growing renewable technology by 2022. SolarSaver is currently completing a number of solar projects for manufacturing, retail and fuel businesses in South Africa and Namibia, while it has completed and manages 110 existing installations.
