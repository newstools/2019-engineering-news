The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) on Thursday received approval from the Rail Safety Regulator to operate new trains along the Pretoria–Pienaarspoort corridor, in Mamelodi. “The deployment of the new trains also known as the ‘people’s train’ is testament to the success of the Minister’s War Room initiative, which focuses on service recovery, safety management and aims to accelerated capital programme implementation,” said PRASA CEO Dr Nkosinathi Sishi. The running of the new trains during the morning peak will improve the overall quality of operations, while also making more trains available during the morning peak period, which has the highest demand for trains. “The deployment will improve our on-time performance, train availability and allow PRASA to continue to improve the overall functionality of the Mamelodi line,” noted Sishi.
