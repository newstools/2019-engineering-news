South African Aerospace, Maritime and Defence Industries Association executive director Simphiwe Hamilton has affirmed that South Africa is on the rebound. He was delivering the keynote address at the official launch of Hensoldt South Africa on Wednesday night. (Hensoldt South Africa is the Germany-based global sensor systems group Hensoldt’s new South African subsidiary, merging its previous two local operations, Hensoldt Optronics South Africa and GEW Technologies.) “It may not seem so at the moment,” he said. “We are [however] working very hard to rebuild the country.” And to rebuild its credibility with international investors. The country’s problems were well known, he observed. One of these, as far as the local defence industry was concerned, was the inadequate defence budget. The sector was arguing for this to be increased. “Our future [however] can never be defined by these challenges,” he affirmed. The defence industry was a high-technology sector of the South African economy, although it must never forget national issues like poverty and inequality. To stimulate the defence sector’s exports, the industry needed to encourage the South African authorities to enter into government-to-government agreements on defence sales. In addition, the local industry itself had to encourage more partnerships between local companies and international groups, like Hensoldt, while retaining their South African identity. (Hensoldt South Africa is partly-owned by South African companies.) Hamilton congratulated the Hensoldt group on the consolidation of their South African operations through the creation of Hensoldt South Africa. “This is a very bold and much appreciated vote of confidence in South Africa,” he said.
