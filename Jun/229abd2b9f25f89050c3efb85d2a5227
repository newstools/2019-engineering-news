LSE- and JSE-listed packaging and paper group Mondi on Friday confirmed that “good progress” was being made in simplifying the company’s corporate structure. This included the processes to obtain the necessary regulatory consents, Mondi said in a statement. Given that not all of the regulatory consents had been received yet, the indicative date for fulfilment or waiver of the conditions for the simplification had been extended. Completion of the simplification was expected in the second half of the year, the company confirmed.
