The Competition Commission has approved Murray & Roberts' (M&R's) proposed buyout of Opti Power Projects and Opti Power HR. Opti Power provides power transmission and distribution services. M&R in March said the R37-million acquisition would give its power and water platform access to the transmission, distribution and substation sectors of the power market in South Africa. The commission found that the proposed transaction was unlikely to result in a substantial prevention or lessening of competition in any relevant markets. The commission also determined that the proposed transaction did not raise any employment or public interest concerns.
