Business Unity South Africa (Busa) has lamented the absence of “real implementation plans” from President Cyril Ramaphosa’s June State of the Nation Address (SoNA) and has urged him to work with business to table a clear implementation plan, with timeframes and milestones, to address South Africa’s prevailing economic “crisis”. Busa president Sipho Pityana said in a statement that the “time for talking is over, we must enter the realm of implementation, and we must do it quickly”. “As business, we stand ready and willing to play a meaningful and constructive role, as we believe that the government cannot go it alone. But we need detail, and we need it soon, if we are to strengthen confidence at home and abroad,” Pityana added. Busa welcomed Ramaphosa’s commitment to a social compact and said it was prepared to work with him in building such a consensus in the national interest. However, such a compact could not avoid hard decisions and should send unequivocal messages in support of building investor confidence.
