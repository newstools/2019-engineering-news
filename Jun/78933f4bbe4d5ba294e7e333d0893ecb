The Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has taken delivery of a new survey craft, the SS Sonar. It is the latest acquisition by TNPA’s dredging services division as part of its ongoing fleet replacement programme. The vessel, valued at about R1.5-million, was built by local company Dams Maintenance and Industrial Supplies and replaces the existing survey craft, which is 32 years old and has reached the end of its operational life. “Although the survey craft is one of the smaller vessels in our dredging fleet, it is a critical tool for keeping our ports at the correct depths for safe navigation. We use the survey craft to conduct single beam hydrographic surveys around the ports, as well as to measure the physical environment under water for any potential impact on marine activities,” TNPA dredging services executive manager Carl Gabriel says. The TNPA dredging fleet ensures that the entrance channels, basins and berths at all South African ports are well maintained.
