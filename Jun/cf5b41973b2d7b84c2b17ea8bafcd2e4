Liberty Two Degrees (L2D) and Liberty Group, co-owners of Liberty Midlands Mall, have completed the R12-million installation of a 1 MW solar photovoltaic (PV) plant at the centre. The plant was commissioned on the roof structure of the mall’s 22 000 m2 Lifestyle Centre. The plant is designed and manufactured to operate for at least 25 years. “The move towards harnessing solar energy at Liberty Midlands Mall was deemed necessary for us in light of the world’s urgent need to address climate change,” says Liberty Midlands Mall asset management executive Brian Unsted. He adds that the plant will reduce the mall’s carbon footprint and act as a benchmark for the roll-out of similar projects across L2D’s portfolio. “L2D is passionate and dedicated to improving its environmental impact wherever possible.”
