Eskom has welcomed a high court judgement ordering Trillian to pay back the R595-million it earned in an "unlawful and invalid" contract. The Gupta-linked advisory firm was ordered by the High Court in Pretoria on Tuesday to pay back the money after the utility in March 2018 launched a bid to set aside its payments to the firm as well as global consultancy McKinsey. McKinsey paid back close to R1-billion last year. In a statement on Friday Eskom chairperson Jabu Mabuza said the debt-laden utility "looks forward to receiving the money". He urged other corporates who had conducted illegal business with the utility to "come forward voluntarily". "Our resolve, together with management, to recover all ill-gotten gains from the period of what has become known as state capture at Eskom will persist until all moneys due to Eskom have been recovered.‚Äù The embattled utility is facing a debt of almost R500-billion, according to Bloomberg calculations.
