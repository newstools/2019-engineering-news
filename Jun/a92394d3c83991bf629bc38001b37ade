Aurora Power Solutions and Sola Future Energy are combining forces to form Sola Group, bringing together a large solar project pipeline, including 48 MW in Zambia and 79 MW in South Africa. The two companies merged in March 2018 and, as of June 1, have consolidated their offering as a vertically integrated renewable energy company, offering all stages of solar photovoltaic (PV) implementation – from project development and financing, design, procurement, construction, to the operation and maintenance of solar PV facilities. “It is fitting that two historically interlinked companies, Aurora Power Solutions and Sola Future Energy, combine forces to form the Sola Group,” CEO Dominic Wills said. He indicated that Sola Group’s main objective was to help unlock the economic potential of entire communities across Africa, through access to energy. “With the merger, the combined expertise and experience of the group will ensure that higher energy consumption demands, which will enable the servicing of large-scale clients throughout the African continent, can be met. “With government recently opening the way for businesses to generate their own electricity and feed this into the national grid, the time was right to consolidate our offering, to remove barriers to clean energy and use our business as a force for good, in both commercial and utility markets in South Africa,” he said. He added that resurgence in oil and gas production, deep declines in the cost of renewable energy sources and growing electrification were changing the face of the global energy system and upending traditional ways of meeting energy demand. “This is an exciting time for Sola Group, as it enters the next stage of growth. Joining the two companies will enable the group to provide extensive solar PV services as a consolidated offering to further clean energy in Africa.”
