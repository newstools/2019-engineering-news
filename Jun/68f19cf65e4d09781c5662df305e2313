The audit outcomes of South Africans municipalities continued to deteriorate with only 18 of them achieving clean audits for 2017/18, Auditor General Kimi Makwetu said on Wednesday. Releasing the municipal audit outcomes in a media briefing, Makwetu said of the 257 municipalities and 21 municipal entities assessed, only 51 percent received unqualified audits opinions. "These undesirable state of deteriorating audit outcomes shows that various local government role players have been slow in implementing and in many instances even disregarded the audit office recommendations.

"As a result, the accountability for financial and performance management continues to worsen in most municipalities," he said.
