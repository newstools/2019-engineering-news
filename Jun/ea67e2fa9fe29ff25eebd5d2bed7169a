Suzuki Auto South Africa (SASA) is on the hunt for another yearly sales record. Sales are already up 9.8% for the first five months of this year, to 5 114 units, compared with the same period last year. This achievement comes amid a depressed national new-vehicle market, which is down 4.1% year-to-date. Suzuki sold a record-breaking 12 123 units in 2018, growing by 37% in a year in which the general market declined by 1%. Suzuki is a specialist in the smaller, more affordable car segment and serves as proof of the current buying-down trend in the South African market, nudged along by a struggling domestic economy. SASA sales growth has seen an expansion within the Japanese manufacturer’s dealer network, which has grown from 48 dealers at the end of 2017, to the current 59 dealers. The newest additions to the list are in Botswana; Kyalami, in Gauteng; and Hillcrest, in Durban. SASA confirms that other possible dealer locations are being scouted. “Building a strong dealer network is paramount to our success,” says SASA sales and marketing divisional manager André Venter. “We rely on our dealers to maintain the high standards that Suzuki has become known for, while welcoming hundreds of new customers every month. This network, together with our brand, products and effective measurement and feedback is our recipe for success.” SASA will boost its product portfolio with the launch of the Swift Sport and Vitara Turbo this year, as well as the improved availability of the popular Jimny 4x4. The Jimny, fresh from its category awards in the World and South African Car of the Year Awards, sold 17 units in May. Due to Suzuki’s attempt to catch up with global demand, supply to South Africa was restricted for four months. However, SASA says it expects to receive more than 100 units a month as from July onwards.
