JSE-listed Emira Property Fund’s refurbished warehouse facility, in Denver, Johannesburg, has opened its doors and is attracting tenants looking for state-of-the-art facilities paired with contemporary office space and energy efficiency. The real estate investment trust invested R8.2-million in refurbishing the facility, which now allows the industrial property to offer easy highway access. The refurbishment of the Denver warehouse speaks to Emira’s commitment to improving the quality of its assets, Emira COO Ulana van Biljon says. She adds that, following the upgrades, Emira is now able to offer “even more value with [the company’s] modern approach to both warehousing and business operation needs”. The upgraded warehouse property also offers waterwise, landscaped gardens and a new gatehouse positioned at a reconfigured entrance point with electric gates, supporting both security and ease of access. New parking canopies have been installed to cover 100 of the 114 parking bays and new fencing surrounds the entire perimeter. “What makes this upgraded industrial facility even more attractive are the affordable rental costs and generous tenant allowances. We have identified a need for affordable, modern and convenient warehousing space and the Denver property addresses this perfectly,” Van Biljon elaborates.
