Mechem, part of the Denel Group, says it has recorded notable results in Turkey with the clearance of landmines in a “dangerous” border area. Since the start of demining operations on the eastern border of Turkey in mid-2016, it has found and destroyed about 45 000 landmines and helped to make vast tracts of land safe for human activities. “The successful operations are confirming Mechem’s reputation as one of the leading demining companies in the world,” comments Mechem acting GM Warren Faro. Clearance is done manually by teams trained by Mechem with the support of mine detecting dogs. Landmines were previously used along the Turkish borders to prevent illegal migration and cross-border crime. Turkey has launched an initiative, sponsored by the European Union and the Turkish government, to destroy all its landmines by 2022. The 2019 season began in April and, thus far, 4 802 mines have been found and destroyed.
