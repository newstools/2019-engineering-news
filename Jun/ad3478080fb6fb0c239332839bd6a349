Railway Safety Regulator (RSR) CEO Nkululeko Poya has resigned. The embattled CEO’s resignation comes after he was placed on suspension in November 2017. The RSR said Poya had faced 14 charges, including alleged gross misconduct, abuse of power, dishonesty, dereliction of duty and defying the authority of the board, besides others. “After careful consideration of the detrimental impact Poya’s actions had on the regulator’s reputation and financial position, the board of the RSR views his resignation as an admission of guilt and in the best interest of the organisation,” RSR chairperson Dr Zethu Qunta said. Qunta added that, following Poya’s suspension, the organisation “has been restored and fully recovered from the financial strain experienced during his tenure”.
