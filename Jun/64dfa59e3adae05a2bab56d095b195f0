The Competition Commission has referred a consent settlement agreement between itself and wood-based panel manufacturer Sonae Arauco to the Competition Tribunal for confirmation. The commission on Monday said Sonae had admitted to price fixing and collusive conduct in the wood-based commodity industry and agreed to pay a fine of nearly R47-million.
