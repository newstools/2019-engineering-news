South African State-owned regional airline SA Express (SAX) affirmed on Friday that it was making substantial progress in its turnaround programme. It has also been taking action against employees found to have been engaged in wrongdoing. All those employees who have been charged with offences, and found to be guilty, have been fired from the airline. In those cases in which the offences involve alleged violations of the law, the airline has opened criminal cases. It will use legal means to recoup any losses that were the result of these various offences. SAX also gave the assurance that the airline was not facing imminent liquidation because of a court action being brought against it by a service provider. It described such claims as “false rumours”. “As the current Board of SA Express we are excited about the progress that the airline continues to make despite concerted efforts by competitors and detractors to destabilise the airline,” asserted board chairperson Tryphosa Ramano. “They can all see the significant progress and recovery that the airline is making, which means stronger competition for those operators who stand to gain from its demise, while those entities which had irregular dealings with the airline are unhappy that their contracts are under review under SAX’s new Board and Management.”
