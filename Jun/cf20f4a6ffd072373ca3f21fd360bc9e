Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng on Friday lamented the high level of unemployment in South Africa, stating that it was at odds with a country with vast natural resources and hardworking people, as evidenced by their display of mettle to do the “unthinkable” and transition from Apartheid to a democracy. Mogoeng, speaking at the Directors Event, hosted by the Sunday Times newspaper in Sandton, questioned why the country had degenerated since achieving democracy, positing that a significant contributor to the problem was a loss of the value system that guided South Africans in pursing success, prosperity, justice and freedom for all. “It seems that after achieving democracy, we thought the Constitutional laws would implement themselves. People stopped being overly committed to value systems and principles that explained how the impossibility of defeating Apartheid became a possibility.” Mogoeng indicated that there was a proper framework, and viable institutions, for good governance in the country and, therefore, the proper value systems needed to be re-enacted to inculcate these. “We often look for big or sophisticated solutions, but what appears to be small matters the most – what we teach our kids about tribalism, xenophobia, racism . . .” He also called for proper structures to be put in place to ensure that those in positions of leadership were qualified and suitable. He emphasised that in addition to being credible, these leaders had to be subject to scrutiny. Mogoeng added that there was need for serious reflection on how political parties were funded.
