Growthpoint Properties’ multimillion-rand 144 Oxford road development is set for completion in October. The nine-storey, 35 000 m2 office development comprises two office towers. Designed by Paragon Architects, the building comprises a northern and southern wing connected by a central link. “Large office floorplates are unusual in the Rosebank area even though they are in high demand. An advantage of 144 Oxford is its sizeable floors, which can easily accommodate a whole organisation’s operations on a single level,” said Growthpoint asset management: office head, Paul Kollenberg. Growthpoint chief development and investment officer Rudolf Pienaar adds that, “flexibility and sustainability are everything in business today and we are proud to be developing extraordinary offices that empower agility and high-performance workspaces at 144 Oxford.” The building is being developed by Growthpoint’s in-house trading and development team, which has been the “driving force” behind some of South Africa’s most recognisable developments. The premium office address is designed for a 4-Star SA Green Rating by the Green Building Council South Africa, which means it is more resource-efficient and more cost-efficient than other buildings. It also features standby power and water. The building offers generous parking in six basement levels, with easy access from its dedicated traffic signalled entrance from Oxford road. “Naturally, its prominent presence on the main road creates superb visibility and excellent signage opportunities,” says Growthpoint.
