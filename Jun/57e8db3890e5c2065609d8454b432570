The South African Local Government Association’s (Salga’s) National Executive Committee has appointed Councillor Thembisile Nkadimeng as president of the association. She succeeds former Salga president Parks Tau, who has been appointed Deputy Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister. Nkadimeng previously held the position of Salga Limpopo provincial chairperson. She is only the second female to lead Salga nationally. The appointment of Nkadimeng, as a representative from a local municipality, also marks the first time a Salga president has not come from a metropolitan municipality, and is expected to contribute to advancing the vision of the Integrated Urban Development Framework (IDUF), Salga said. The IUDF aims to create “liveable, safe, resource-efficient cities and towns that are socially integrated, economically inclusive and globally competitive, where residents actively participate in urban life”.
