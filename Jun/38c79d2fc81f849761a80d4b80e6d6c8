JSE-listed information technology services group EOH has appointed Dr Xolani Mkhwanazi chairperson, effective immediately. “His record of providing courageous leadership in challenging business environments, coupled with his commitment to sound corporate governance, were key drivers for his appointment,” said CEO Stephen van Coller. Mkhwanazi will lead board deliberations on all group matters and, more immediately, the findings of the investigation commissioned by EOH into public sector contracts being undertaken by law firm ENSAfrica. Mkhwanazi had served as chairperson of BHP Billiton in South Africa from 2008 to 2015 and as president and COO of South Africa Aluminium with BHP Billiton from 2005. Prior to that, he was CEO of Bateman Africa and the National Electricity Regulator, which became the National Energy Regulator of South Africa in 2004. Mkhwanazi resigned from a deputy chairperson position at the Public Investment Corporation in February. He is currently also an independent nonexecutive director for JSE-listed construction group Murray & Roberts and director at South32 South Africa Coal Holdings.
