National aviation safety regulators should continue to align their technical validation timelines and requirements for the safe restoration to service of the Boeing 737 MAX airliner, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) has urged. The association also urged that there be alignment on extra training requirements for the flight crews of the aircraft. “The Boeing 737 MAX tragedies weigh heavily on an industry that holds safety as its top priority,” affirmed Iata director-general and CEO Alexandre de Juniac. “We trust the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA], in its role as the certifying regulator, to ensure the aircraft’s safe return to service. And we respect the duty of regulators around the world to make independent decisions on [the] FAA’s recommendations.” “At the same time, aviation is a globally integrated system that relies on global standards, including mutual recognition, trust, and reciprocity among safety regulators,” he stressed. “This harmonised structure has worked successfully for decades to help make air travel the safest form of long distance travel the world has known. Aviation cannot function efficiently without this coordinated effort, and restoring public confidence demands it.” Iata issued its recommendations after the conclusion of its second Boeing 737 MAX Summit, held in Montreal, Canada, on Wednesday. The summit was attended by more than 40 agencies and organisations, including airlines, aircraft lessors, aviation-related associations, safety regulators, original equipment manufacturers and training organisations. The Boeing 737 MAX suffered two crashes in just five months in late 2018 and early 2019, which killed a total of 346 people. It is the fourth generation of the hitherto renowned 737 single-aisle airliner family. Iata is the trade association for the world’s airlines. It has some 290 member airlines, which together account for 82% of global air traffic.
