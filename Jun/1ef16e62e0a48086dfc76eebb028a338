Global space, community and services company WeWork has established an office in Cape Town, the second city in South Africa where it is launching a presence. WeWork will take up four floors in the city’s eleven-floor 80 Strand street property, which is co-owned by Emira Property Fund and Swish Property Group. “Since announcing our expansion to South Africa, we have seen great interest from companies of all sizes, including JSE-listed Naspers, [which] will be moving into our first location in Johannesburg later this year,” said WeWork Europe, Middle East and Africa real estate head Patrick Nelson.
