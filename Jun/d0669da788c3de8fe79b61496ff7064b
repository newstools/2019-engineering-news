The government of Seychelles has launched a request for proposals (RfP) process for an independent power producer floating solar photovoltaic project. A group of prequalified bidders, which were selected in 2018 as part of the first phase of procurement, will be required to submit their full technical and financial proposals in September. The prequalified bidders are Building Energy South Africa, Cobra Instalaciones y Servicios SA, Générale du Solaire and Total Eren, GreenYellow SAS and Voltas Ecobiotech, Masdar, Quadran (Seychelles) and Vetiver Tech, Scatec Solar ASA, and Solar Philippines and Corex Solar. The proposals will be evaluated against a set of technical and financial criteria. The preferred bidder will finance, design, build, own and operate the plant. Construction is expected to start soon after the preferred bidder is chosen in November, with the project scheduled to start operating in 2020. The project will be located in Providence lagoon on Mahé Island and is set to have an estimated capacity of between 3.5 MW to 4 MW. It was launched by the Seychelles Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change and the Seychelles Energy Commission, and will support the country’s transition to renewable energy. The project is being implemented by the government of Seychelles and the Public Utilities Corporation with the support of the African Legal Support Facility and the Clinton Foundation, with Trinity International and Multiconsult Norge serving as the transaction and tender advisers. Electricity generated from the plant will be sold to the Public Utilities Corporation at a fixed tariff under a 25-year power purchase agreement. Last week, the government of Seychelles hosted a prebid meeting and site visit to brief prequalified bidders on the tender process, the site and the build area. The prequalified bidders were able to view the lagoon and related sites in person, network with local contractors and ask questions for clarification to the project team.
