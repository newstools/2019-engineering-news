JSE-listed Intu Properties has appointed Robert Allen CFO, effective June 10. CEO Matthew Roberts says Allen has  “extensive and highly relevant experience in refinancing, mergers and acquisitions, treasury, information technology and investor relations”. This is expected to help Intu drive its strategy of delivering strong underlying performance, adapting to the fast-changing retail environment and making smart use of capital. Barbara Gibbes, who has been acting as interim CFO, will resume her duties as FD and will report to Allen.
