This year’s iteration of the Naamsa Automotive Conference will feature two themes that will be linked under the overall slogan of ‘Reimagining the future together’. The first theme, ‘Embracing innovation as an indispensable catalyst for prosperity and sustainable growth’, will interrogate how best the industry can use the Automotive Masterplan, which is expected to be in place from 2021 to 2035 and aims to increase localisation, double production and grow employment within the automotive industry. The second theme, ‘Automotive trends, technology and consumer behaviour’, will examine the increasingly digital ecosystem and disruptive landscape in which the automotive industry finds itself. The conference will include a programme of varied topics, which cover all major aspects of the industry, and will feature top-level speakers, including international experts, Naamsa CEO Mike Mabasa said on Thursday. The event, which was fully subscribed last year, will again have the backing of Innovation Group and AutoTrader. The conference will be held at the Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit and Conference Centre, in Midrand, on August 22 as part of the annual Festival of Motoring presented by WesBank.
