The decline in engineering projects and a shortage of engineering skills are issues of concern to engineers, the 2019 PPS Graduate Professional Index (GPI) results have revealed. An overwhelming 78% of engineers believe there has been a decline in South African engineering project opportunities, the index indicates. Meanwhile, many believe the decline in projects and lack of skills have had the biggest impact on the profession. “While the economy has provided some constraints for employment and new projects, there is the need to address national challenges, as 76% of respondents are of the opinion that government’s strategic integrated projects programme has been realised – and many believe this has had a great impact on them,” says PPS technical marketing specialist Motshabi Nomvete. PPS conducted an independent survey of 5 837 members at the beginning of this year to gauge their perceptions on a number of issues affecting the engineering, accounting, dental, legal, medical, pharmaceutical and other professions. At 60%, engineering tied with pharmaceutical graduate professionals as the fourth most confident of professions. The most confident were accountancy at 86%, other at 80% and legal at 65%. Medicine at 56% and dental at 47% were at the bottom of the pack.
