One of the bookrunners handling Airtel Africa's planned initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange said on Monday it had received indications of interest worth about $200-million from pre-IPO investors. Airtel Africa, a unit of India's Bharti Airtel, last week set a price range of 80p to 100p a share for its IPO, which is expected to raise 595-million pounds from the issuance of 595.2-million to 744-million new shares.
