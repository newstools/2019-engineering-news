Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) has appointed Busisiwe Mavuso CEO, effective July 1. Mavuso has been serving as BLSA’s COO since November 2017 and succeeds Bonang Mohale, who is retiring to pursue farming. Prior to joining BLSA, Mavuso was MD of the Black Management Forum. She commented that South Africa had been through a bad period of corruption and malfeasance, partly because business did not provide leadership. “South Africa is currently in a dire economic position and I am looking forward to leading business in implementing the necessary interventions to enable us to play a constructive role in the capacitation of the State and the acceleration of inclusive socioeconomic growth.”
