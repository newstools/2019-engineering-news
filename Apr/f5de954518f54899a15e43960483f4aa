North West province premier Job Mokgoro has committed to ensuring that issues raised by the Batlhaping Ba-Ga Phuduhucwane traditional council are addressed to resolve an impasse in the implementation of the Taung dam maintenance project by the department of water and sanitation. Mokgoro assured the community of Taung that the maintenance of the dam, which was nearing completion before the standoff, would enable sufficient capacity for additional water to reach 126 villages and the Naledi local municipality in Vryburg which is also experiencing water shortages, his office said in a statement. Mokgoro said the provincial government would make sure that new development projects were implemented and those that had stalled were resuscitated. To this end, member of the executive council for public works and roads Gaoage Molapisi assured the Shaleng community that the road to the area from Sekhing would be on the department’s priority list and be budgeted for construction in phases from the 2021/22 financial year. Mokgoro is also scheduled to meet stakeholders in Vryburg and Ganyesa as part of efforts to resolve challenges in delivering services.
