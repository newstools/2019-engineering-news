Vehicle telematics and tracking services provider, Ctrack, has launched a customisable video monitoring solution for rental vehicles, light delivery vehicles, fleet vehicles, trucks, general machinery and buses. With Ctrack Iris, the number of side or back cameras used within the solution can be specified by individual customers, says Ctrack MD Hein Jordt. Video footage can be recorded in eight quality settings, from common intermediate format (CIF) to 1080 p. Live, real-time video streaming can be viewed on mobile devices. Apart from the cameras, the solution is further equipped with rear vehicle door triggers, a lockable video device, two-way communication system, fatigue and other advanced driver assistance systems, as well as an onboard/reverse screen. GPS, Wi-Fi, 3G and accelerometer modules can also be included. Ctrack Iris is supported by Web-based, desktop software and a password protected mobile application. These platforms also provide geofence/point-of-interest information, live tracking and video and dashboard event management. With Ctrack Iris, fleet owners can reduce the number of insurance claims they submit and settle the claims they do submit much faster, notes Jordt. Iris can also be used to lower fuel consumption and improve vehicle maintenance through better driving, while reducing diesel and goods-in-transit theft, he adds. “By monitoring crew activities, it is possible to improve and enforce company processes and procedures and reduce theft, pilferage and stock damage. “Furthermore, the new video solution from Ctrack, combined with a tracking device, can improve vehicle route optimisation, increase load frequency and hasten turnaround times.”
