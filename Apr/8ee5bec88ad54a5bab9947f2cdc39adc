Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies will on Thursday launch the first phase of the revitalisation of the Ekandustria industrial park, near Bronkhorstspruit. The R49-million first phase forms part of the Department of Trade and Industryâ€™s Revitalisation of Industrial Parks Programme. Davies said in a statement that the main objective of the programme is to accelerate economic growth, attract business investment, promote transformation and encourage the establishment of black industrialists in the industrial parks. The programme is also aimed at supporting job creation in manufacturing and related sectors. The Ekandustria industrial park has a 56% occupancy rate comprising a mixture of tenants who operate in a variety of business industries, with a focus in manufacturing, including construction materials, food, recycling, clothing and textiles. The revitalisation of Ekandustria will comprise upgrading of the security infrastructure, including fencing, the installation of boom gates, pedestrian and vehicular gates and the construction of guard houses; the installation of insulation and ventilators; and the refurbishment of the wastewater treatment plant in the park.
