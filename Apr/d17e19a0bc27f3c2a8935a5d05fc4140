The South African Council for the Architectural Profession (SACAP) on Monday indicated its readiness to receive applications from thousands of architectural practitioners who have failed to pay their SACAP fees, for amnesty. SACAP in March announced a three-month amnesty period, to run from April 1 to June 30, for practitioners who were deregistered owing to the nonpayment of fees. In terms of the amnesty, removed persons will be required to pay a predetermined fee as amnesty. This fee is made up of an administration fee for reregistration and the normal annual fee for the current financial year. Without amnesty, deregistered practitioners will be required to pay the fee for the year he/she was removed, a penalty fee, an administration fee for reregistration, as well as the current annual fee. “We have, since sending out communiques and media statements to our stakeholders such as Voluntary Associations and media, we have been receiving high numbers of calls and emails from de-registered practitioners who are interested in taking advantage of the amnesty,” said SACAP acting registrar Advocate Toto Fiduli. “By all accounts, we believe this is encouraging news as it indicates that a significant part of those 12 000-or-so deregistered architectural practitioners want to, take advantage of this process in order to be re-registered.” Those wishing to take advantage of the amnesty are urged to visit SACAP’s website (www.sacapsa) for more information, as well as the relevant application form. Alternatively, SACAP can be contacted on (011) 479 5000 or by email on amnesty2019@sacapsa.com.
