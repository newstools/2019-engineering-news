The Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammernarbeit, in rolling out its Energy Efficiency Street Lighting Retrofit Project, has called for companies to submit bids for the supply of 36 light-emitting-diode (LED) floodlight luminaires with telemanagement systems. In cooperation with the Department of Energy, these floodlights will be retrofitted on six high masts in the Katlehong region, in Ekurhuleni. The project, which is funded through a co-funding grant agreement from the Swiss State Secreteriat for Economic Affairs, supports street lighting LED retrofits in South African municipalities in order to generate best practice models and build capacities in promoting energy efficiency in the public street lighting sector in South Africa. Companies that are interested in submitting a bid should send their company name on a letterhead, physical address and telephone number; a copy of their company registration certificate and tax clearance certificate; and the contact details for the person who will be responsible for the procurement process to procurement-department-pretoria@giz.ze before April 23.
