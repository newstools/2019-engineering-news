The Gauteng provincial government has adopted the Gauteng Transport Authority (GTA) Bill. The Bill provides for the creation of a transport authority across the Gauteng city region, incorporating the provincial Department of Roads and Transport and various municipal transport administrations. “This is a vital step for integrated transport planning and coordination of public transport operations across the province,” says Gauteng Roads and Transport MEC Dr Ismail Vadi.
 
“Over the past four years we have worked hard to conceptualise the transport authority, consult municipalities on the structure and study international best practice to get to this point.”
 
The GTA – once legally established – will coordinate the planning, integration and enforcement of public transport operations in the province, such as the bus rapid transit systems, Metrorail, Gautrain and taxi services.
 
The authority is set to transform currently fragmented public transport governance and coordinate the management of public transport services.
 
“An improved transport system will have a major impact on the lives of Gauteng residents since it is one of the primary means of access to employment, services and social activities,” says Vadi.
 
He adds that a better public transport system will lead to less private vehicle use. The Gauteng Transport Authority will be responsible for integrated transport planning across local and provincial boundaries; contracting and management of subsidised transport services and enforcement and regulation of public transport operations.
 
The GTA will be governed by a board of directors, which will be broadly representative of the authorities it is coordinating, as well as a number of transport specialists.
