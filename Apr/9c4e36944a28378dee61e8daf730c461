State-owned Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has approved further studies to be done into a Sea Water Reverse Osmosis, or desalination, plant at the Port of Cape Town. TNPA Cape Town acting port manager Alex Miya said in a statement on Monday that the next step would be to appoint consultants to conduct the studies, which is expected to be finalised by September. “If the desalination plant is found to be a viable option, it could be introduced by the end of 2020.” The proposed location for the plant is the Quay 700 area in the port, which could provide between one-million and three-million litres a day of water.
