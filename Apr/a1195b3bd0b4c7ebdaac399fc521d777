Amid a tough customer landscape, food and beverage producer Libstar Group intends to drive in-depth analysis of category gaps and new product innovation – particularly through its Southdale-based Dickon Hall Foods facility – this year to increase its customer relationship advantage and develop additional channels. Under the Libstar umbrella of innovation, the company intends to allocate significant capital to new technologies, efficiency improvements and integration opportunities, as well as capacity expansion in key categories. The company also intends to exploit trends touching on areas such as health, wellness, on-the-go and convenience eating, as well as private labels – which constitute about 44% of the group’s revenue. In showcasing some of its capabilities and capacities, Libstar on Tuesday invited media to tour its Dickon Hall Foods facility, which is the company’s largest contributor to revenue and earnings in Libstar’s ambient groceries category. Along with Cape Herb and Spice and Rialto Foods, the facility contributes 86% to the group’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. Speaking to media, Dickon Hall Foods business unit head Niel van Heerden highlighted that the facility’s strategy is to leverage its customer relationships in both retail and wholesale channels to grow its branded and housebrand sales. It intends to continue seeking new customers and channels, as well as extend its partnerships with existing customers through “innovative world class new product and alternative packaging development”. Dickon Hall Foods is responsible for the production of various brands such as Mrs Balls Chutney, Robertsons Baking Powder and Kellogg’s Noodles.
