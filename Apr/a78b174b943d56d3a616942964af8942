Port of Elizabeth’s Tanker Berth on Friday welcomed its first vessel, the UAAC Mirdif, after completion of berth repairs. The vessel delivered white oil to Nelson Mandela Bay. The berth was closed from February 18 to allow for repairs to be conducted on the corroded steel structures supporting the berth’s access walkway. The repairs were concluded by March 25 and the berth was recertified by a structural engineer.
