Inspiring Fifty has called for South Africans and those in the technology ecosystem to nominate their most inspiring female role models for this year’s Inspiring Fifty South Africa – a nonprofit initiative that benchmarks and awards the 50 most inspiring women in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). To meet the criteria, a nominee must be a founder of a technology company; hold a C-level position at a technology company; or be an influencer, academic or politician in the technology or innovation space. This year marks the third edition of the initiative. The celebration of the women’s event is set to take place in August. The initiative is based on the belief that “if she can see it, she can be it”, and it values the positive impact that increased diversity has on business growth, innovation, culture and productivity. Inspiring Fifty South Africa ambassador Ellen Fischat said she was looking forward to expanding the event with the support of the winners, as well as the support from #cocreateSA, an initiative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in South Africa.
