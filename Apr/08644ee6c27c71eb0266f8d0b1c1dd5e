The Clough Salini joint venture (JV) has been appointed as the contractor for the Snowy 2.0 hydropower project, in New South Wales, Australia. The JV’s scope of work on the project is valued at about A$1.8-billion, spanning over the next five years. Clough, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of JSE-listed Murray & Roberts, has a 35% shareholding in the JV. The tender formed part of the group’s strategy to extend its oil and gas platform’s service offering to complementary markets, while the lack of opportunities in the Australasian liquefied natural gas sector continues. Salini, and its US affiliate Lane, are experienced in executing hydropower developments, and, combined with Clough, create a JV capability that will deliver the Snowy 2.0 project for the benefit of the Australian community. Snowy 2.0 will expand the generation capacity of Snowy Hydro's Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme by 2 000 MW, with the first power from the expanded project expected in late 2024. The project will link two existing Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme dams – Tantangara and Talbingo – through underground tunnels and an underground power station with pumping capabilities. The power station will comprise six reversible Francis pump-turbine and motor-generator units.
