The Competition Commission has referred a case of alleged cartel conduct against network maintenance companies KF Computers and SAAB Grintek Defence to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution.
 
The two firms have been charged with alleged collusive tendering in respect of a tender that was put out by the State Information Technology Agency (Sita) for the provision of network maintenance and system support services to the South African Air Force’s Ground Command and Control Systems and its Current Intelligence System.
 
Sita in March 2016 submitted a complaint to the commission, alleging that KF Computers and SAAB Grintek Defence may have coordinated their response to the tender. The commission found that the companies had allegedly discussed and agreed as to their respective tender bids in response to the Sita tender advertisement.
 
The commission has asked the tribunal to impose a fine of 10% of the respective companies’ turnovers.
