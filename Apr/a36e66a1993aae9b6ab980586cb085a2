RBR Group expects to benefit from Chevron Corporation’s plans to proceed with the proposed Area 1 liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, in Mozambique. It was announced last week that Chevron would acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, which is the operator of the Area 1 LNG project, for $33-billion in cash and shares. RBR on Monday said it had positioned itself to be a key supplier of labour, skills assessment and training services for the Area 1 project, as well as two other major LNG projects scheduled for construction in Mozambique in the near term. Anadarko CE Al Walker had noted during the LNG 2019 conference, in Shanghai, earlier this month that a final investment decision on the first two trains – with a planned capacity of 12.88-million tonnes a year of LNG – was “very close”. RBR CE Richard Carcenac said RBR looked forward to providing services to what would be one of the biggest construction projects in the world for many years, should it proceed. “We have established the largest database of workers in Mozambique, we have the pre-requisite labour licence and we are a fully accredited training organisation in line with Mozambique’s requirements,” Carcenac said.
