Eskom COO Jan Oberholzer has been appointed to the board of directors of the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) – an international organisation that conducts research and development related to the generation, delivery and use of electricity for the benefit of the public. EPRI’s international participation extends to more than 30 countries, including South Africa. A seat on this board gives the power utility direct access to some of the most cutting edge energy research available and assures Eskom a position to influence EPRI’s strategic direction and work programme. “We wish to congratulate Oberholzer on his appointment as part of the board at EPRI. This gives him an opportunity to further serve the broader energy industry over and above his responsibility of serving Eskom and South Africa,” commented Eskom CE Phakamani Hadebe.
