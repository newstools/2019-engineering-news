Financial innovation consultancy SystemicLogic has acquired property data and information and communication technology company Knowledge Factory from media organisation Kagiso Media for an undisclosed sum. Knowledge Factory offers a range of solutions based on property data and marketing insights, giving businesses an understanding of different target markets in the financial, hospitality, fast-moving consumer goods, property and media industry sectors. Reliable market data highlights needs and opportunities for clients, supporting informed strategic decision-making, SystemicLogic CEO Audrey Mothupi said in a statement issued on Tuesday. “The acquisition combines the expertise and experience of the two organisations and will enhance the data, digital and innovation offerings that are available to help clients improve operational efficiencies, navigate revenue growth opportunities and ensure risk mitigation,” she explained. The two businesses complement each other strategically and the acquisition signals a new growth phase for SystemicLogic. Both companies work with clients to help them navigate the technology world and use innovation to solve problems. Together, the companies can offer better service and more innovative solutions, Mothupi added. “Disruption and innovation are relentless and our objective is to help companies make sense of all the changes they face, working with them as they evolve and become thriving businesses.” “Knowledge Factory identifies existing and potential data sources, conducts analyses and makes sense of the data before using it to address business problems,” explained Knowledge Factory CEO Ashwin Frankie.
