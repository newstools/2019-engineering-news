Defence minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula will on Friday revisit Emfuleni Local Municipality to give a joint report on the development and work done thus far at the Vaal River rehabilitation project. Last year, the SA National Defence Force (SANDF) deployed about 300 of its specialized engineers to do clean-up work of the Sebokeng Waste Water Treatment Plant and other sources of sewage pollution of the Vaal River in the Emfuleni District. But the work to rebuild the collapsed waste-water system faced financial challenges earlier this year as the project needed R873-million from National Treasury. The area has been facing a threat of environmental and health risks as raw sewage has been flowing into the river from pump stations in the Emfuleni municipality on the northern bank of the Vaal River. The department said that Mapisa-Nqakula's visit will be to obtain a technical report on the implementation of the project, conduct site visits to stations that have been rehabilitated and engage with communities that have been affected by spillage of raw sewage.
