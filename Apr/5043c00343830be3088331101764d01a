Energy group Total has started production at Kaombo Sul, the second floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit of the Kaombo project, located on Block 32, 260 km off the coast of Luanda, Angola, in water depths ranging from 1 400 m to 2 000 m. Kaombo Sul, which was brought on line eight months after Kaombo Norte started production, will add 115 000 bbl/d of output, taking overall production capacity at the Kaombo project to 230 000 bbl/d – equivalent to 15% of the country’s production. The associated gas from Kaombo Sul will be exported to the Angola liquefied natural gas plant, as part of the group’s commitment to stop routine flaring. “Leveraging the experience of Kaombo Norte, Kaombo Sul started up in the best possible condition,” Total exploration and production president Arnaud Breuillac commented in a statement on Tuesday. “This second FPSO stands out as an excellent example of standardisation to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Its start-up will contribute to the group’s cash flow and production growth in 2019 and beyond,” he added. He highlighted that the achievement demonstrates Total’s commitment to Angola, with the group developing a short cycle project on Block 17 in parallel, and preparing to drill an exploration well on Block 48. The full Kaombo development comprises six fields spread over an area of 800 km2. Gengibre, Gindungo and Caril were connected to the Kaombo Norte FPSO, which started up last year, while the three fields of Mostarda, Canela and Louro have now been connected to Kaombo Sul. The project comprises a large subsea system including 59 wells (with over 60% of them already drilled) and two FPSO units which were converted from very large crude carriers. Total operates Block 32 and holds a 30% participating interest.
