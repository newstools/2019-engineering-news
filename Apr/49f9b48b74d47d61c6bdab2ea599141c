President Cyril Ramaphosa granted a judicial commission an extra three months to finish its investigation into allegations of wrongdoing at the government workers’ pension-fund manager. The date by which the commission of inquiry into the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) must submit its final report was moved to July 31 from April 15, the commission said in a statement posted on its Twitter account on Saturday. The commission, whose mandate was also broadened, is still probing a “considerable number of transactions” and hearing testimony from former and current employees into allegations of wrongdoing. The South African manager of more than R2-trillion in government workers’ pension funds has been wracked by allegations of making questionable investments. Ramaphosa set up the commission in October after a whistle-blower said there was wrongdoing. PIC’s nine directors, including chairperson Mondli Gungubele, who is also deputy finance minister, resigned in February and acting CEO Matshepo More was suspended on March 27.
