Brand South Africa (Brand SA) has appointed Thulisile Manzini acting CEO. This follows the suspension of CEO Dr Kingsley Makhubela, owing to a number of charges being pursued in a disciplinary process. Brand SA said in a release on Tuesday that Manzini has more than 20 years’ experience in public service, having held various roles in government, including that of deputy director-general for governance and administration at the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services. “We believe Manzini is the right person to drive the organisation forward during this period. “Her experience has more than prepared her to fulfil this role with excellence, we are confident that she will propel the many strategic initiatives that Brand SA undertakes, to inspire and unify our stakeholders, partners and employees, to continue the work of building the reputation of South Africa, so as to contribute to its global competitiveness,” Brand SA chairperson Khanyisile Kweyama said.
