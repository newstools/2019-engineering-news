From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: Private locomotive and rail operation Traxtion last month showcased its new maintenance and refurbishment facility, in Rosslyn, as part of the company’s plans to increase its capacity to provide locomotive rebuild and overhaul services for Africa. Simone Liedtke, who attended the event, tells us more. Simone Liedtke: The Traxtion facility, which CEO James Holley believes to be the first of its size in Africa, is on the third phase of its planned eight-phase development, with R68-million having been invested to date. The facility will see a total investment of R130-million once all phases have been completed. In speaking to Engineering News on the day of the showcase, Holley tells us a bit about the rationale behind embarking on this new investment. Traxtion CEO James Holley: Simone Liedtke: During the tour of the facility, Holley elaborated on some of the facility’s capabilities, adding that, in future, three additional rail lines will be added to further increase the facility’s capacity. Once done, this will increase the facility’s rail lines from five, to eight. Traxtion CEO James Holley: Simone Liedtke: However, despite the intended increased capacity for the maintenance and refurbishment facility, Holley emphasized that the manufacturing of locomotives, or key component parts, are not on the cards for the Rosslyn-based facility. Traxtion CEO James Holley: Sashnee Moodley: That’s Creamer Media’s Real Economy Report. Join us again next week for more news and insight into South Africa’s real economy.
