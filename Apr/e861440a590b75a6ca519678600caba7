Executive Mayor Herman MashabaÂ will on Monday unveil another batch of properties to be launched by the Johannesburg Property Company to the private sector for development across the city, his office said. "The full prospectus of properties is expected to draw an investment value of between R20-billion and R25-billion over the entire development period," Mashaba's office said. The properties, many of which are grouped into large portions of land, are being released across several areas including Randburg, Rosebank, Orange Grove, Houghton and Wynberg with the aim of establishing mixed-use developments, affordable housing and student accommodation.
