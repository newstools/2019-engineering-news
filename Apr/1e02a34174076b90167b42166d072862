Independent power producer (IPP) Globeleq and renewable energy company Sola Group’s Aurora Power Solutions have been awarded two 20 MW solar photovoltaic (PV) projects, in Zambia. These projects form part of the Get Fit Zambia programme, through which the government aims to procure 200 MW of renewable energy projects within the next three years. The Globeleq and Sola consortium was selected as one of ten consortiums to submit two project proposals after an initial qualification stage. Globeleq CEO Paul Hanrahan believes that this award is a “direct result” of the consortium’s project development and execution capabilities, coupled with its experience in Africa, as well as its ability to submit a competitive tariff. The consortium submitted a tariff of $0.045/kWh for its Aurora Sola One and Two projects. “We are delighted to move forward towards the realisation of the Zambian government’s commitment to provide the country with least-cost clean energy," Hanrahan added. Sola board member and Aurora Power Solutions founder Dr Chris Haw comments that, once built, these projects will provide reliable and clean electricity to the Zambian government for 25 years. “The competitive pricing of the awarded projects shows the affordability of solar PV as an energy source. Zambia’s commitment to procure clean energy is not just about supporting a low carbon future, it is also about providing affordable energy to grow its economy,” he said. The first phase of Get Fit Zambia’s procurement of renewable energy allows for 120 MW of solar PV capacity. During their first year, the awarded projects are expected to produce 360 GWh of clean power for the country and will encourage economic development and implementation of local capacity building programmes.
